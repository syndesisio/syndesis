### Syndesis operator
Syndesis is a flexible and customizable, open source platform that provides core integration capabilities as a service.

This operator installs as well as configures the following syndesis components:
- syndesis-server
- syndesis-meta
- syndesis-ui
- syndesis-db
- syndesis-prometheus
- syndesis-proxy
- syndesis-oauthproxy

### How to install
When the operator is installed (you have created a subscription and the operator is running in the selected namespace) create a new CR of Kind Syndesis (click the Create New button). The CR spec contains all defaults (see below).

### CR Defaults
The CR definition is pretty simple and an empy CR will trigger a base installation.

Within the addons section, users are able to enable specific addons. The available addons at the moment are:
- jaeger: enable jaeger
- ops: enables monitoring, requires extra CRDs
- todo: a simple todo application

To enable addons, set "addon_name": {"enabled": true} in the CR.
