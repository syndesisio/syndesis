# This is required in both the hybrid and default cases:
# 1) In the default case, the jaeger instance is initialised by the
#    syndesis-enabled jaeger-operator and the query url expects to
#    access the 'noauth-syndesis-jaeger-query' service;
# 2) In the hybrid case, the user has requested syndesis enable the
#    jaeger operator but not create a CR. However, the query url from
#    the syndesis server still expects 'noauth-syndesis-jaeger-query'
#    and the jaeger instance is still 'owned' by the syndesis-enabled
#    operator so this service is still required.
#
# Only in the client-only use-case is this not necessary because the user
# would be expected to override the queryUrl and collectorUrl seeing as
# the jaeger-instance would be completely independent and have no relation
# to the default service hostnames.
