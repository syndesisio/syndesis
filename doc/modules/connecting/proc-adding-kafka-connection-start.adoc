= Obtaining data from a Kafka broker to trigger integration execution

To trigger execution of an integration upon receiving data
from a Kafka broker, add a Kafka connection as the start connection. When 
the integration is running, the Kafka connection continuously watches for data
in the Kafka topic that you specify. When the connection finds new data,
it passes that data to the next step in the integration. 

.Prerequisite
You created a connection to a Kafka broker.

.Procedure

. In the {prodname} panel on the left, click *Integrations*.
. Click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a connection* page, click the Kafka connection that
you want to use to start the integration. 
. On the *Choose an action* page, select the *Subscribe* action
to receive data from the topic that you specify. 
. In the *Topic Name* field, click the down carat to display a list
of topics and click the topic that you want to subscribe to. 
Or, type a topic name to create that topic. 
. Click *Next* to specify the action's output type. 

. In the *Select Type* field, if the data type does not need to be known, 
accept *Type specification not required* 
and click *Next*. You do not need to follow the rest of these
instructions.

However, a structured data type is recommended. For example, if you want 
to map the Kafka connection output to a subsequent step then you must 
specify the data type. The data mapper does not recognize unstructured data. 
+
To specify the data type, click in the *Select Type* field and select one of the following as the schema type:
+
* *JSON schema* is a document that describes the structure of JSON data.
The document's media type is `application/schema+json`. 
* *JSON instance* is a document that contains JSON data. The document's 
media type is `application/json`. 
* *XML schema* is a document that describes the structure of XML data.
The document's file extension is `.xsd`.
* *XML instance* is a document that contains XML data. The
document's file extension is `.xml`. 
* *CSV instance* is a document that contains comma-separated value (CSV) data. The document's file extension is `.csv`. 
ifeval::["{location}" == "downstream"]
+
*Note* _Data Mapper support for CSV data is a Technology Preview feature only._
endif::[]

. In the *Definition* input box, paste a definition that conforms to the
schema type you selected. 
For example, if you select *JSON schema* then you would paste the content of
a JSON schema file, which has a media type of `application/schema+json`.

. In the *Data Type Name* field, enter a name that you choose for the
data type. For example, if you are specifying a JSON schema for
vendors then you might specify `*Vendor*` as the data type name. 
+
You will see this data type name when you are creating 
or editing an integration that uses the connection
for which you are specifying this type. {prodname} displays the type name
in the integration visualization and in the data mapper. 

. In the *Data Type Description* field, provide information that helps you
distinguish this type. This description appears in the data mapper when 
you hover over the step that processes this type. 
. Click *Next*. 

.Result
The integration now has a start connection and {prodname} prompts
you to choose the finish connection.
