= Creating a connection to an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint

In an integration, to execute the HTTP `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`, 
`HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, or `PATCH` method, create a connection to
an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint. You can then add the connection to one
or more integrations. 

.Prerequisite
You must know the URL for the endpoint that you want to connect to.

.Procedures

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to
display any available connections.
. Click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connectors.
. If you want to use Hyper Text Transfer Protocol to connect to the endpoint, 
then click the *HTTP* connector. If you want to use
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure, then click the 
*HTTPS* connector.
. In the *Base URL* field, enter the endpoint path. For example, 
`www.mycompany.com/sales`.
. Click *Validate*. {prodname} immediately tries to validate the 
connection and displays a message that indicates whether 
validation is successful. If validation fails, revise specification
of the base URL and try again.
. If validation is successful, click *Next*.
. In the *Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections.
For example, enter `*HTTPS My Company Sales*`.
. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection.
. Click *Save* to see that the connection you
created is now available. If you entered the example name, you would
see that *HTTPS My Company Sales* appears as a connection that you can 
choose to add to an integration.
