= Triggering an integration when a MongoDB collection is updated

To trigger execution of an integration when a document is added to a 
MongoDB collection, add a MongoDB connection to a simple integration as its start 
connection. When the integration is running, the MongoDB connection
monitors the database collection that you specified when you created the 
integration. Insertion of a new document
into the collection that the connection is configured to monitor 
triggers execution of the integration. The MongoDB connection 
returns the new document to the integration and this data is available
to the next step in the integration. 

.Prerequisites
* You created a MongoDB connection. 
* You know the name of the MongoDB collection
that you want the connection to read.
* If the collection that you want the connection to monitor is a capped
collection, then you must also know: 
** The name of the MongoDB collection field that tracks incoming documents. 
** Whether persistent tracking is enabled for the database that
contains the collection.
** How to specify tail tracking information related to the data 
that you want the connection to read. MongoDB connections can use tail
tracking information to resume an action after an unexpected connection 
termination. Tail tracking ensures that when the connection resumes its
activity, it does not return duplicate data to the integration nor does it
drop any data that needs to be returned to the integration. 

.Procedure

. In the {prodname} panel on the left, click *Integrations*.
. Click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a connection* page, click the MongoDB connection that
is configured to access the database that you want the integration 
to obtain updates from. 
. On the *Choose an action* page, select one of these actions:
+ 
* *Retrieve documents (stream)* is typically the action that you want 
to select. It retrieves data from non-capped collections. 
* *Retrieve documents (tail)* is the action for retrieving data from 
capped collections. 

. Configure the action: 
.. In the *Collection name* field, enter the name of the MongoDB 
collection that you want the connection to read. 
+
If you are configuring the *Retrieve documents (stream)* action, 
this is the only required parameter. Go to step 6. If you are
configuring the *Retrieve documents (tail)* action, follow the 
remaining substeps.
.. In the *Collection field used to track incoming documents* field, 
enter the name of the relevant MongoDB collection field.
This field contains data that can be sorted, such as a date or an ID. 
.. Select the *Persistent tracking enabled* checkbox if persistent 
tracking is enabled for the database that you want the connection 
to read. 
.. Optional. In the *Unique id to identify this tracking process* field, 
specify a unique ID if there are multiple consumers that monitor the same 
collection. For more information, see the Camel documentation for 
link:https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/mongodb-component.html#_tailable_cursor_consumer[Tailable Cursor Consumer].
.. Optional. In the *DB used to store tail tracking* field, enter 
the name of the MongoDB database that contains tail tracking information. 
.. Optional. In the *Collection used to store tail tracking* field, enter
the name of the collection that contains tail tracking information. 
.. Optional. In the *Field used to store tail tracking* field, enter the name of 
the field that stores tail tracking information for the collection that this
connection is reading.  

+
To identify the tail tracking field, you can specify the tail tracking database
or tail tracking collection. With one of these pieces of information, the connection can
find the tail tracking field. 

. Click *Next* to specify the action's output type. 

. In the *Select Type* field, if the data type does not need to be known, 
accept *Type specification not required* 
and click *Next*. You do not need to follow the rest of these
instructions. 
+
However, a structured data type is recommended. For example, if you want 
to map the connection output in a data mapper step then you must specify 
the data type. The data mapper cannot display fields for unstructured data.
+
To specify the data type, click in the *Select Type* field and select one of the following as the schema type:
+
* *JSON schema* is a document that describes the structure of JSON data.
The document's media type is `application/schema+json`. 
* *JSON instance* is a document that contains JSON data. The document's 
media type is `application/json`. 
* *XML schema* is a document that describes the structure of XML data.
The document's file extension is `.xsd`.
* *XML instance* is a document that contains XML data. The
document's file extension is `.xml`. 
* *CSV instance* is  a document that contains comma-separated value (CSV) data. The
document's file extension is `.csv`. 

. In the *Definition* input box, paste a definition that conforms to the
schema type you selected. 
For example, if you select *JSON schema* then you would paste the content of
a JSON schema file, which has a media type of `application/schema+json`.

. In the *Data Type Name* field, enter a name that you choose for the
data type. For example, if you are specifying a JSON schema for
vendors then you might specify `*Vendor*` as the data type name. 
+
You will see this data type name when you are creating 
or editing an integration that uses the connection
for which you are specifying this type. {prodname} displays the type name
in the integration visualization and in the data mapper. 

. In the *Data Type Description* field, provide information that helps you
distinguish this type. This description appears in the data mapper when 
you hover over the step that processes this type. 
. Click *Next*. 

.Result
The integration now has a start connection and {prodname} is prompting
you to choose the finish connection. 

During execution, the connection returns the inserted document in 
JSON format.
