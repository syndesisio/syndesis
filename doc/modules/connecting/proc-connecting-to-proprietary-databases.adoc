= Connecting to proprietary databases

To connect to a proprietary SQL database, the main tasks that must be
accomplished are as follows:

. A developer creates a library extension that contains the JDBC driver 
for the database that you want to access in an integration. See 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#creating-jdbc-driver-library-extensions_extensions[Creating JDBC driver library extensions].

. The developer provides a `.jar` file that contains the library extension.

. You upload that `.jar` file to {prodname}. See 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#making-extensions-available_add-extension[Making extensions available].

. You create a connection to your database by selecting the 
{prodname} *Database* connector and specifying the connection URL
for your database. See 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#create-database-connection_db[Creating a database connection].

. In an integration, you add the connection to your database. 
See 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#adding-db-connection-start_db[Starting an integration by accessing a database] or 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#adding-db-connection-finish-middle_db[Accessing a database in the middle or to complete an integration].
