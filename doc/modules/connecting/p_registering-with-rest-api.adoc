= Registering {prodname} as a REST API client

Before {prodname} creates a REST API client
connector, it prompts you to indicate the API's security requirements.
For APIs that use the OAuth protocol, when {prodname} creates the connector it also
adds an entry for the API to the {prodname} *Settings* page. This is
where you provide the API client ID and the API client secret that
authorize {prodname} to access the API.

If the API you want to connect to does not use OAuth, skip this
section and see 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#create-rest-api-connection_rest[Creating a REST API client connection].

.Prerequisite
You must know the URL for the OAuth custom application setting page for the
REST API that you want to connect to.

.Procedure

. In {prodname}:
.. On the *Settings* page, near the top, to the right of the callback URL, click
image:../../images/tutorials/CopyCallback.png[Copy Callback URL] to 
copy the callback URL for your {prodname} environment to the clipboard. 
You will need this URL later in this procedure. 
.. Look for the name of the API you want to connect to and click it
to display its client ID and client secret fields.

. In another browser window, you must register {prodname} as an OAuth
client of the API you want to connect to. The exact steps for doing this
vary for each API service. Typically, the API service provides an OAuth
custom application setting page. Go to that page and do the following:

.. Provide the {prodname} callback URL, which you copied at the beginning
of this procedure.
.. Respond to any other prompts that require your input. 
.. Obtain the client ID and client secret that the API service assigns to
your {prodname} environment.

. Return to the {prodname} *Settings* page entry for the 
API service you are registering with and do the following:
.. Paste the assigned client ID.
.. Paste the assigned client secret.
.. Click *Save*.
