= Operating on documents in a MongoDB collection

In an integration, you can search for, update, delete, count, or 
add a document to a MongoDB collection. To do this, add a 
MongoDB connection to the middle of a flow or as a simple 
integrationâ€™s finish connection.
 
.Prerequisites
* You created a MongoDB connection. 
* You know the name of the MongoDB collection
that you want the connection to operate on.
* You are creating or editing an integration and {prodname} is
prompting you to add to the integration. Or, {prodname} is 
prompting you to choose a finish connection.  

.Procedure

. On the *Add to Integration* page, click the plus sign where you 
want to add a MongoDB connection. Skip this step if you are adding 
a simple integration's finish connection. 
. Click the MongoDB connection that you want to use.  
. On the *Choose an action* page, select the action that you want the
connection to perform.
. To configure the action, in the *Collection name* field, enter 
the name of the collection that you want the connection to 
operate on. 
+
If you selected the *Insert* action:
+
* You are done configuring the connection.
* Ensure that the data that the integration passes to this 
MongoDB connection contains JSON notation that specifies the
document to add to the collection.
* Click *Next* to add this connection to the integration. 

. For all other actions, the following table provides information 
about what to specify in the second field for configuring the action. 
+
The second field is a JSON notation expression that identifies 
the document(s) to operate on and possibly, details for the 
operation. If you plan to map an incoming source field to an 
identifier in the expression, specify `:#_variable-name_` in 
the expression. 
+
For completeness, the *Insert* action is described in this 
table as well.

|===
|Action
|What it does
|Parameter field
|Returns

|*Count*
|Counts the number of documents that satisfy the count expression that you specify.
|In the *Count expression* field, specify a JSON filter expression in the form of `{"test":"unit"}`. 
The action counts the number of documents that have a `test` attribute value of `unit`.
|An instance of `java.lang.Long` that specifies the number of documents that were found.

|*Delete*
|Removes one or more documents from the collection. 
|In the *Delete expression* field, specify a JSON expression in the form of `{"test":"unit"}`. 
The operation removes each document whose `test` attribute has a value of `unit`.
|An instance of `java.lang.Long` that specifies the number of documents that were deleted.

|*Find*
|Looks for all documents that match the filter expression that you specify.
|In the *Filter expression* field, specify a JSON notation string that identifies one or more documents. 
|JSON notation that specifies a list (an array). Each list element identifies a document that matches the 
filter expression and provides the document content. If no documents are found, the action returns an empty list. +
 +
You must be familiar with the data model of the collection. If the collection adheres to a JSON schema, 
you must be familiar with this schema because the returned list elements adhere to this schema. For additional information, see 
link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/data-modeling/[MongoDB Data Models]. +
 +
To use output data from the *Find* action in a subsequent data mapper step, 
the collection must adhere to a JSON schema. This enables the data mapper to 
display data fields. For more information, see 
link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/#json-schema[MongoDB documentation for JSON schema validation].

|*Insert*
|Adds one or more documents to the collection. 
|There is no action configuration parameter for inserting a document. The data coming in 
to the MongoDB connection must contain JSON notation that specifies one ore more documents to add to the collection.
|JSON notation that specifies a list (an array). Each list element is a document that this action inserted. 

|*Update*
|Updates one or more documents in the collection. 
|In the *Filter criteria* field, specify an array of 2 arguments. 
The first argument is a filter expression that identifies the documents to update. 
The second argument is a MongoDB update statement that specifies how to update the documents. Update statement 
format is described in link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.update/[]. For example: 
`[{"_id":11},{$set: {"test":"updated!"}}]`.
|An instance of `java.lang.Long` that specifies the number of documents that were updated.

|*Upsert*
|Updates one or more documents in the collection or creates a document if no documents match the *Upsert expression*. 
|In the *Upsert expression* field, specify JSON notation that identifies one or more documents. The action uses this expression 
to detect any matching documents. If the action finds a matching document(s) in the collection, it updates it. If the action does 
not find a matching document, the action creates a new document. 
The data coming into the MongoDB connection must contain JSON notation that specifies:

* An `_id` field to identify whether it is an insert or an update operation.

* The content to add or update.

|An instance of `com.mongodb.client.result.UpdateResult` that specifies either the number of updated documents or the ID of the new, inserted document.
|===
+
Each action returns a response. If this is a finish connection, then 
the response is lost, but you can add a *Log* step to capture the response. 

. Click *Next*. 

. Optional. If this is a finish connection, add a *Log* step to finish the 
integration instead. Configure the *Log* step to capture the response.

.Result
The connection appears in the integration visualization where
you added it. 

.Next steps
Add any other needed connections to the flow. Add any other steps that 
process data. Complete the integration by adding any needed data mapping steps. 
When you configured the MongoDB connection action, if you specified any 
`:#_variable-name_` identifiers in an action expression, be sure to map a 
source field to the MongoDB connection variable field.
