= Creating Amazon DynamoDB connections

You must create an Amazon DynamoDB connection before you can 
connect to Amazon DynamoDB in an integration.

.Prerequisites

* You must have an AWS access key. See 
link:{LinkSyndesisConnectorGuide}#obtaining-aws-credentials_aws[Obtaining AWS credentials for creating connections to Amazon services].
* You must know which AWS region contains the DynamoDB table that
you want the connection to access. 
* You must know the name of the DynamoDB table that you want the 
connection to access. This table must exist when an integration
connects to DynamoDB. 

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to
display any available connections.
. Click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connectors.
. Click the *Amazon DynamoDB* connector.
. In the *Access Key* field, enter an Amazon access key ID that is 
part of a user access key in the AWS account that manages 
the DynamoDB table that you want the connection to access. 

. In the *Secret Key* field, enter the Amazon secret access key for the 
Amazon access key ID that you specified.

. In the *Region* field, select the AWS region in which the DynamoDB table resides.

. In the *Table Name* field, enter the name of
the DynamoDB table that you want this connection to access.

. Click *Validate*. {prodname} immediately tries to validate the
connection and displays a message that indicates whether or not
validation is successful. If validation fails, revise the configuration
details as needed and try again.
. When validation is successful, click *Next*.
. In the *Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections.
For example, enter `DynamoDB West`.
. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. For example,
enter `*Sample DynamoDB connection
that accesses sales data in the western region.*`
. Click *Save* to see that the connection you
created is now available. If you entered the example name, you would
see that *DynamoDB West* appears as a connection that you can 
choose to add to an integration.

.Results

When {prodname} is prompting you to add to an integration, it 
displays the DynamoDB connection that you just created. 
This connection always and only accesses the DynamoDB table
that you specified when you created the connection.
