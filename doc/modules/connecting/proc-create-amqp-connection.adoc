= Creating an AMQP connection

In an integration, to obtain messages from or publish messages to an AMQP
broker, create an AMQP connection, which you can add to an integration.

.Prerequisites
For the AMQP broker that you want to connect to, you have the following:

* Its URI
* User account credentials
* Its PEM certificate text

.Procedure
. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to 
display any available connections. 
. Click *Create Connection* to display
connectors.  
. Click the *AMQP Message Broker* connector.
. Configure the connection: 
+
.. In the *Connection URI* field, enter the location you want to send data
to or obtain data from. 
.. In the *User name* field, enter the user name for the account that you want
to use to access this broker. 
.. In the *Password* field, enter the password for the account that you want
to use to access this broker. 
.. In the *Client ID* field, enter the ID that allows connections to close 
and reopen without missing messages. The destination type must be a topic. 
.. If this connection will be used in a development
environment, you can save some time by disabling
*Check certificates*. Disabling the checking of certificates is a convenience for
development environments. For secure production environments, always enable 
*Check certificates*.
.. In the *Broker certificate* field, paste the broker's PEM certificate text.
This is required except when you disable the 
checking of certificates. 
.. In the *Client certificate* field, paste the client's PEM certificate text. 
Content in this field is always optional. 
. Click *Validate*. {prodname} immediately tries to validate the 
connection and displays a message that indicates whether 
validation is successful. If validation fails, revise the configuration
details as needed and try again. 
. If validation is successful, click *Next*. 
. In the *Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections. 
For example, you might enter `AMQP 1`.
. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. For example,
enter `*Sample AMQP connection*`
. Click *Save* to see that the connection you 
created is now available. If you
entered the example name, you would 
see that *AMQP 1* appears as a connection that you can 
choose to add to an integration.
