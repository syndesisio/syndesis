= Creating Amazon SQS connections

You must create an Amazon SQS connection before you can add an
Amazon SQS connection to an integration.

.Prerequisites

* AWS access key. See link:{LinkSyndesisConnectorGuide}#obtaining-aws-credentials_aws[Obtaining AWS credentials].

* You must know the region in which the SQS queue is located. 
This is the queue that you want the SQS connection that 
you are creating to send messages to or retrieve messages from. 

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to
display any available connections.
. Click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connectors.
. Click the *Amazon SQS* connector.
. In the *Access Key* field, enter an Amazon access key ID that is 
part of a user access key in the AWS account that manages 
the queue that you want the connection to access.
+
If the queue that you want the connection to
access does not already exist then when {prodname} tries to start running the 
integration, it uses the AWS account associated with this access key to 
create the queue. However, if the queue already exists in some other 
AWS account, then the connection cannot create the queue and the 
integration cannot start. 

. In the *Secret Key* field, enter the Amazon secret access key for the 
Amazon access key ID that you specified.

. In the *Region* field, select the AWS region in which the queue resides.
If the connection creates the queue, then it creates it in the
selected region.
. Click *Validate*. {prodname} immediately tries to validate the
connection and displays a message that indicates whether or not
validation is successful. If validation fails, revise the configuration
details as needed and try again.
. When validation is successful, click *Next*.
. In the *Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections.
For example, enter `SQS South`.
. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. For example,
enter `*Sample SQS connection
that sends messages to our southern region queue.*`
. Click *Save* to see that the connection you
created is now available. If you entered the example name, you would
see that *SQS South* appears as a connection that you can 
choose to add to an integration.
