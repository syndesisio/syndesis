= How to develop library extensions

A library extension provides a resource that an 
integration requires at runtime. A library extension does not contribute steps or 
connectors to {prodname}. 

When you save an integration, you can optionally select one or more imported library extensions that you want to include with the integration.    

A library extension does not define any actions. 
Here is a sample definition for a library extension:

[source,json]
----
{
  "schemaVersion" : "v1",
  "name" : "Example JDBC Driver Library",
  "description" : "Syndesis Extension for adding a custom JDBC Driver",
  "extensionId" : "io.syndesis.extensions:syndesis-library-jdbc-driver",
  "version" : "1.0.0",
  "tags" : [ "jdbc-driver" ],
  "extensionType" : "Libraries"
}
----

Other than the lack of actions, the structure of a library extension 
is the same as the structure of a step or connector extension. 

In a Maven project that creates a library extension, to add dependencies 
that are not available from a Maven repository, 
specify a `system` dependency, for example: 

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.company</groupId>
    <artifactId>jdbc-driver</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>${project.basedir}/lib/jdbc-driver-1.0.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>
