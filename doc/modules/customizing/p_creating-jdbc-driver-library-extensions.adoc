= Creating JDBC driver library extensions

To connect to a SQL database other than Apache Derby, MySQL, and
PostgreSQL, you can create a library extension that wraps a JDBC driver for
the database you want to connect to.
After uploading this extension to {prodname}, the {prodname}-provided
*Database* connector can access the driver to validate and create connections
to the proprietary database. You do not create
a new connector for your particular database.

The Syndesis open source community provides a project for creating an
extension that wraps a JDBC driver.

Package one driver only in an extension. This makes
it easier to manage the extension as part of managing your particular database.
However, it is possible to create a library extension that wraps more than one driver.

.Prerequisites
To use the Syndesis project, you must have a GitHub account.

.Procedure

. Ensure access to the JDBC driver for the database you want to connect to
by doing one of the following:
.. Confirm that the driver is in a Maven repository.
.. Download the driver.
. In a browser tab, go to
https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-extensions
. Fork the `syndesis-extensions` repository to your GitHub account.
. Create a local clone from your fork.
. In your `syndesis-extensions` clone:
.. If the driver is not in a Maven repository, copy the
driver into the `syndesis-library-jdbc-driver/lib` folder.
.. Edit the `syndesis-library-jdbc-driver/pom.xml` file:
... Update the value of the `Name` element to be a name that you choose
for this extension.
... Update the value of the `Description` element to provide helpful
information about this extension.
... If you have copied the driver into `syndesis-library-jdbc-driver/lib`
ensure that the `systemPath` in `pom.xml` points to that driver file. Optionally change
the `groupId`, `artifactId` and `version` to reflect proper values according to the driver.
... If the driver is in a Maven repository, ensure that a reference to
that Maven dependency is in the `pom.xml` file.
... Examine the rest of the content of the `pom.xml` file and change
any relevant metadata as needed.
.. Execute `./mvnw -pl :syndesis-library-jdbc-driver clean package` to build the extension.

The generated `.jar` file is in the `syndesis-library-jdbc-driver/target`
folder. Provide this `.jar` file for uploading to {prodname}.

[NOTE]
====
{prodname} does not yet offer a way to select which library extension(s) an
integration should include. When you add a database connection to an
integration, {prodname} adds all extensions that have
the `jdbc-driver` tag to integration runtime. This is expected to
improve in a future release.
