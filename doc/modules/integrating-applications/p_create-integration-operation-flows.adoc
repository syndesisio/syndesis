= Creating the operation flows for an API provider integration

The OpenAPI document that defines your REST API service defines
the operations that the service can perform. After you create an API
provider integration, you can edit the flow for each operation. 

Each operation has exactly one flow. 
In an operation flow, you can add connections
to other applications and services, as well as steps that operate on data
between connections. 

As you add to operation flows, you might find that you need to update
the OpenAPI document that the API provider integration is based on. To do this, 
click *View/Edit API Definition* in the upper right of a page in which
you are editing your API provider integration. This displays your document
in the API Designer editor. In your OpenAPI 
definition, as long as each operation has a unique `operationId` property, 
you can save your updates in API Designer and {prodname} can synchronize the
API provider integration's flow definitions to have your updates. 

.Prerequisites

* You created an API provider integration, gave it a name, and saved it.
* You created a connection to each application or service that you want
an operation flow to connect to. For details, see the
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#about-creating-connections_connections[information about creating connections].
* {prodname} is displaying the list of operations that the API defines. 

.Procedure

. In the *Operations* list page, for the operation
whose flow you want to edit, click *Create flow*. 

. For each connection that you want to add to this flow:
.. In the flow visualization, click the plus sign to add a connection
at that location. 
.. Click the connection that you want to add. 
.. Select the action that you want this connection to perform.  
.. Configure the action by entering data in the labeled fields. 
.. Click *Next*. 

+
Add all desired connections to the flow
before you continue. 

. In this operation flow, to process data between connections:
.. In the flow visualization, click the
plus sign where you want to add a step. 
.. Click the step that you want to add. 
.. Configure the step by entering data in the labeled fields. 
.. Click *Next*. 

+
For help, see
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#about-adding-steps_create[Adding steps between connections].

+
If you want to add another step that processes
data between connections, repeat this subset of instructions. 

. Map data to fields in the next connection: 
.. In the flow visualization, check for data type mismatch 
image:../../images/integrating-applications/DataTypeMismatchWarning.png[data mismatch] icons, which
indicate that the connection cannot process the incoming data. You need
to add a data mapper step here. 
.. For each data mismatch icon in the flow visualization:
... Click the plus sign that is just before that step. 
... Click *Data Mapper*.
... Define the needed mappings. For help, see
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#mapping-data_ug[Mapping integration data to fields in the next connection].
... Click *Done* to add the data mapper step to the flow. 

. In the flow visualization, on the 
*Provided API Return Path* step, click *Configure*.  
+
Every API provider integration finishes each operation flow by 
sending a response to the REST API caller that triggered execution of 
the operation flow. The response contains one of the return codes 
that you configure for the *Provided API Return Path* step that 
finishes the operation’s flow. Configure the return path step as follows: 

.. Under *Default Response*, in the *Return Code* field, accept 
the default response that {prodname} displays, or click the down 
caret and scroll to select the default response that you want. 
The flow sends this response when execution of the operation 
flow does not return any of the configured error responses. 
Typically, the default response return code indicates a successful operation. 


.. Under *Error Handling*, indicate whether you want to include 
the error message in the body of the returned message. 
+
During development, you typically want to return the error message. 
In production, however, you might want to hide the error message if 
it contains sensitive or proprietary information. The error message 
is a JSON formatted string that contains `responseCode`, `category`, 
and `message` elements, for example: 
+
[source,json]
----
   {
      responseCode: 404,
      category:  "SQL_ENTITY_NOT_FOUND_ERROR",
      message: "SQL SELECT did not SELECT any records"
    }
----

.. Under *Error Response Codes*, {prodname} displays an entry for 
each error that a connection in the flow might return. For each 
error, accept the *200 All is good* default return code or click to 
select another HTTP status return code. 
+
The return codes that you 
can select from, are the return codes that the OpenAPI document 
defines for the operation that this flow executes. 
If {prodname} does not display a return code that you need, you can 
edit the OpenAPI document to add it. 
+
To do this, in the upper right, 
click *View/Edit API Definition*. Edit the OpenAPI document as needed. 
When you are done, save the OpenAPI document. {prodname} returns to 
editing the *Provided API Return Path* and reflects any changes that you saved.

.. Click Next to complete configuration of the return path. 


. When this flow has all needed 
connections and steps and there are no data mismatch icons, or when 
you no longer want to edit the flow for now, do one of the following:
* *Publish* -- To start running the integration, in the upper right, click *Publish*.
This builds the integration, deploys the REST API service to 
OpenShift, and makes the integration available to be executed. 
You can publish the integration each time that you
complete the creation of an operation's flow or each
time that you edit an operation's flow.
* *Save* -- To display the list of operations, in the upper right, 
click *Save*.  

Repeat this procedure to edit another operation's flow.

.Testing API provider integrations

* Testing API provider integrations running on one of these platforms:
** OpenShift Online
** OpenShift Dedicated
** OpenShift Container Platform when *API discovery is disabled*

+
You can use the `curl` utility to confirm that the integration is working as 
expected. In the `curl` command, specify the external URL that {prodname} displays
after it publishes the API provider integration. 
For examples of doing this, see the description of the API provider quickstart.

* Testing API provider integrations running on OpenShift Container Platform 
when specifying *API discovery is enabled*
+
An OCP administrator might have set the `OPENSHIFT_MANAGEMENT_URL_FOR3SCALE` 
environment variable. When this environment variable is set,  Red Hat 3scale 
publishes your API provider integration, which means that 3scale controls 
access to the integration’s API. To test the integration, open the 3scale 
dashboard to obtain the integration’s URL. 
+
If you do not want Red Hat 3scale to control access to the integration’s API, 
you can disable discovery. You do this in {prodname} by viewing the integration’s 
summary page. On this page, click *Disable discovery*. {prodname} republishes 
the integration and provides an external URL for invoking integration execution. 
+
You can enable or disable discovery for each API provider integration.
