= Defining the operation flows for an API provider integration

The OpenAPI document that defines your REST API service defines
the operations that the service can perform. After you create an API
provider integration, you can edit the flow for each operation.

Each operation has exactly one flow.
In an operation flow, you can add connections
to other applications and services, as well as steps that operate on data
between connections.

As you add to operation flows, you might find that you need to update
the OpenAPI document that the API provider integration is based on. To do this,
click *View/Edit API Definition* in the upper right of a page in which
you are editing your API provider integration. This displays your document
in the API Designer editor. In your OpenAPI
definition, as long as each operation has a unique `operationId` property,
you can save your updates in API Designer and {prodname} can synchronize the
API provider integration's flow definitions to have your updates.

.Prerequisites

* You created an API provider integration, gave it a name, and saved it.
* You created a connection to each application or service that you want
an operation flow to connect to. For details, see the
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#about-creating-connections_connections[information about creating connections].
* {prodname} is displaying the list of operations that the API defines.

.Procedure

. In the *Operations* list page, for the operation
whose flow you want to define, click *Create flow*.

. For each connection that you want to add to this flow:
.. In the flow visualization, click the plus sign to add a connection
at that location.
.. Click the connection that you want to add.
.. Select the action that you want this connection to perform.
.. Configure the action by entering data in the labeled fields.
.. Click *Next*.

+
Add all desired connections to the flow
before you continue.

. In this operation flow, to process data between connections:
.. In the flow visualization, click the
plus sign where you want to add a step.
.. Click the step that you want to add.
.. Configure the step by entering data in the labeled fields.
.. Click *Next*.

+
For help, see
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#about-adding-steps_create[Adding steps between connections].

+
If you want to add another step that processes
data between connections, repeat this subset of instructions.

. Map data to fields in the next connection:
.. In the flow visualization, check for data type mismatch
image:images/integrating-applications/DataTypeMismatchWarning.png[data mismatch] icons, which
indicate that the connection cannot process the incoming data. You need
to add a data mapper step here.
.. For each data mismatch icon in the flow visualization:
... Click the plus sign that is just before that step.
... Click *Data Mapper*.
... Define the needed mappings. For help, see
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#mapping-data_ug[Mapping integration data to fields in the next connection].
... Click *Done* to add the data mapper step to the flow.

. In the flow visualization, on the
*Provided API Return Path* step, click *Configure*.
+
Every API provider integration finishes each operation flow by
sending a response to the REST API caller that triggered execution of
the operation flow. The response contains one of the return codes
that you configure for the *Provided API Return Path* step that
finishes the operation’s flow. Configure the return path step as follows:

.. Under *Default Response*, in the *Return Code* field, accept
the default response that {prodname} displays, or click the down
caret and scroll to select the default response that you want.
The flow sends this response when execution of the operation
flow does not return any of the configured error responses.
Typically, the default response return code indicates a successful operation.


.. Under *Error Handling*, indicate whether you want to include
the error message in the body of the returned message.
+
During development, you typically want to return the error message.
In production, however, you might want to hide the error message if
it contains sensitive or proprietary information. The error message
is a JSON formatted string that contains `responseCode`, `category`,
and `message` elements, for example:
+
[source,json]
----
   {
      responseCode: 404,
      category:  "SQL_ENTITY_NOT_FOUND_ERROR",
      message: "SQL SELECT did not SELECT any records"
    }
----

.. Under *Error Response Codes*, {prodname} displays an entry for
each error that a connection in the flow might return. For each
error, accept the *200 All is good* default return code or click to
select another HTTP status return code.
+
The return codes that you
can select from, are the return codes that the OpenAPI document
defines for the operation that this flow executes.
If {prodname} does not display a return code that you need, you can
edit the OpenAPI document to add it.
+
To do this, in the upper right,
click *View/Edit API Definition*. Edit the OpenAPI document as needed.
When you are done, save the OpenAPI document. {prodname} returns to
editing the *Provided API Return Path* and reflects any changes that you saved.

.. Click Next to complete configuration of the return path.


. When this flow has all needed
connections and steps and there are no data mismatch icons, or when
you no longer want to edit the flow for now, do one of the following:
* *Publish* -- To start running the integration, in the upper right, click *Publish*.
This builds the integration, deploys the REST API service to
OpenShift, and makes the integration available to be executed.
You can publish the integration each time that you
complete the creation of an operation's flow or each
time that you edit an operation's flow.
* *Save* -- To display the list of operations, in the upper right,
click *Save*.

Repeat this procedure to edit another operation's flow.

.Testing API provider integrations

ifndef::rhmi[]

* Testing API provider integrations running on one of these platforms:
** OpenShift Online
** OpenShift Dedicated
** OpenShift Container Platform when *API discovery is disabled*

+
You can use the `curl` utility to confirm that the integration is working as
expected. In the `curl` command, specify the external URL that {prodname} displays
after it publishes the API provider integration.
For examples of doing this, see
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#try-api-provider-quickstart_api-provider[Testing the example API provider quickstart integration].

* Testing API provider integrations running on OpenShift Container Platform
when *API discovery is enabled*
+
Red Hat 3scale publishes your API provider integration. To test the integration, open the 3scale dashboard to obtain the integration’s URL.
+
You can disable discovery for an API provider integration if, for example, you do not want Red Hat 3scale to control access to the integration’s API or you want to test the API provider integration in {prodname}. If you disable discovery, {prodname} republishes the integration and provides an external URL for invoking and testing integration execution. To do this, in {prodname} go to the integration’s summary page. On this page, click *Disable discovery*. {prodname} republishes the integration and provides the integration’s URL. For examples of how to test an integration, see
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#try-api-provider-quickstart_api-provider[Testing the example API provider quickstart integration]. After testing, you can re-enable discovery for the API provider integration so that 3scale publishes it.
+
You can enable or disable discovery for each API provider integration.
endif::rhmi[]

ifdef::rhmi[]

For Red Hat Managed Integration, API discovery is enabled by default and Red Hat 3scale publishes your API provider integration. To test the integration, open the 3scale dashboard to obtain the integration’s URL.

You can disable discovery for an API provider integration if, for example, you do not want Red Hat 3scale to control access to the integration’s API or you want to test the API provider integration in Fuse Online. If you disable discovery, Fuse Online republishes the integration and provides an external URL for invoking and testing integration execution.

To disable discovery for an API provider integration, in Fuse Online go to the integration’s summary page. On this page, click *Disable discovery*. Fuse Online republishes the integration and provides the integration’s URL.

You can use the `curl` utility to confirm that the integration is working as expected. In the `curl` command, specify the external URL that Fuse Online displays after it publishes the API provider integration.  For examples of how to test an integration, see link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#try-api-provider-quickstart_api-provider[Testing the example API provider quickstart integration].

After testing, you can re-enable discovery for the API provider integration so that 3scale publishes it.
