= About creating connections from {prodname} to applications

To create a connection, you
select the connector for the application that you want to connect to
and then enter values in input fields to configure a connection to that application.
The configuration details that you need to provide vary for each application.
After configuring the connection, you give it a name that helps you
distinguish it from any other connections to the same application.
Optionally, you can specify a description of the connection.

You can use the same connector to create any number of connections to that
application. For example, you might use the AMQ connector to create
three different connections. Each AMQ connection could specify a
different broker.
