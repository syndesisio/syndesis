= Adding a basic filter step

You can add a step to a flow to filter the data that the
flow operates on. In a filter step, {prodname} inspects the
data and continues only if the content meets
criteria that you define. For example, in a flow that
obtains data from Twitter, you can specify that you want to
continue execution by operating only on tweets that contain "Red Hat".

.Prerequisites
* The flow contains all connections that it needs to. 
* You are creating or editing a flow. 

.Procedure

. In the flow visualization, where you want to add a filter step, click the
image:../../images/integrating-applications/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign'].

. Click *Basic Filter*. 

. On the *Configure Basic Filter Step* page, in
the *Continue only if incoming data match* field:
+
* Accept the default that all defined rules must be satisfied.
* Or, select *ANY of the following* to indicate that only
one rule must be satisfied.

. Define the filter rule:

.. In the *Property Name* field, enter or select the name of the field that contains the
content you want the filter to evaluate. For example, suppose the data
coming in to the step consists of tweets that mention your Twitter handle.
You want to continue execution only when the tweet contains
certain content. The tweet is in a field named `text` so you enter or
select `text` as the value in the property name field.
+
You can define the property name in the following ways:
+
*** Start typing. The field has a typeahead feature that
provides a list of possible completions for you in a pop-up box.
Select the correct one from the box.
*** Click in the field. A dropdown box appears with a list of
available properties. Select the property of interest from the list.

.. In the *Operator* field, select an operator from the dropdown box.
The setting defaults to *Contains*. For execution to continue,
the condition that you select in this field must evaluate to 
true for the value that you enter in the *Keywords* field.

.. In the *Keywords* field, enter a value to filter on. For example,
suppose that you accept the default *Contains* operator and
you want to continue integration execution only when the 
incoming text mentions a certain product.
You would enter the product name here.

. Optionally, click *+ Add another rule* and define another rule.
+
You can delete a rule by clicking the trash can icon in the top
right of the rule entry.

. When the filter step is complete, click *Done* to add it to the flow.

to evaluate, see
