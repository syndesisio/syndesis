= Adding a template step

In a flow, a template step takes data from a source and
inserts it into the format that is defined in a template that you upload to {prodname}.
The benefit of a template step is that it provides data output in a
consistent format that you specify.

In the template, you define placeholders and specify static text.
When you create the flow, you add a template step, map source fields
to the template placeholders, and then map template content to the next step
in the flow. When {prodname} executes the flow, it 
inserts the values that are in the mapped source fields into an
instance of the template and makes the result available to the next step 
in the flow.

If a flow includes a template step then it is most likely the only
template step in that flow. However, more than one template step in a
flow is allowed.

{prodname} supports the following kinds of templates:

link:https://velocity.apache.org[Velocity].

.Prerequisites
* You must be creating or editing a flow.
* If you are creating a simple
integration then it must already have its start and finish connections.

.Procedure

. In the flow visualization, click the
image:../../images/integrating-applications/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[Plus Sign]
where you want to add a template step.
. Click *Template*. The
*Upload Template* page opens.
. Specify the template type, which is Freemarker, Mustache, or Velocity. 

. To define the template, do one of the following:
+
* Drag and drop a template file or a file that contains text that you
want to modify to create a template, into the template editor.
* Click *browse to upload*, navigate to a file, and upload it.
* In the template editor, start typing to define a template.

. In the template editor, ensure that the template
is valid for use with {prodname}. Examples of valid templates are 
after this procedure. {prodname} displays
image:../../images/integrating-applications/RedCircleXError.png[a red error indicator] to the left of
a line that contains a syntax error. Hovering over a syntax error 
indicator displays hints about how to resolve the error.

. Click *Done* to add the template step to the flow.
+
If the *Done* button is not enabled then there is at least one syntax error
that you must correct.
+
Input to a template step must be in the form of a JSON object. Consequently,
you must add
a data mapping step before a template step.
. To add a data mapper step before the template step:
.. In the flow visualization, click the
image:../../images/integrating-applications/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[Plus Sign] that is
immediately before the template step that you just added.
.. Click *Data Mapper*.
.. In the data mapper, map a source field to each template placeholder field.
+
For example, using the example templates that are after this procedure, 
map a source field to each of these template fields:
+
* `time`
* `name`
* `text`
.. In the upper right, click *Done* to add the data mapper step to the
flow.

+
Output from a template step is always a JSON object. Consequently, you must
add a data mapper step after a template step.
. To add a data mapper step after the template step:
.. In the flow visualization, click the
image:../../images/integrating-applications/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[Plus Sign] that is
immediately after the template step that you just added.
.. Click *Data Mapper*.
.. In the data mapper, map the template's *message* field, which
always contains the result of inserting source fields into the
template, to a target field. For example, suppose that a Gmail connection is
next in the flow and you want to send the result of the template step
as the content of a Gmail message. To do this, you would map the *message*
source field to the *text* target field.
.. In the upper right, click *Done*.

.Examples of templates

Example of a Mustache template:

----
At {{time}}, {{name}} tweeted:
{{text}}
----

Freemarker and Velocity support this example template:

----
At ${time}, ${name} tweeted:
${text}
----

Velocity also supports syntax without braces, as shown in this example:

----
At $time, $name tweeted:
$text
----

A placeholder cannot contain a `.` (period).
