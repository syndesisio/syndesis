= Importing integrations

In a {prodname} environment, you can import an integration that was
exported from another {prodname} environment. 
Exporting an integration downloads the zip file that you upload
to import the integration.

.Prerequisites
* You have a zip file that contains an integration that was exported from another
{prodname} environment. 

.Procedure
. Open the {prodname} environment that you want to import the integration into.
. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the upper right, click *Import*.
. Drag and drop one or more exported integration zip files,
or navigate to a zip file that contains an exported integration and select it.
+
{prodname} imports the file(s) and display a message when importing
is successful. 
. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the list of integrations, on the entry for the integration 
that you just imported, click *View*. 
. In the integration summary, if there is a notification that
configuration is required, in the upper right, click *Edit integration*. 
. For each connection that requires configuration:

.. Click its *Configure* button to display its details.
.. Enter or change connection details as needed. It is possible that every
field on this page is correct and that only security configuration is required.
.. Click *Next*.
. In the left panel, click *Settings*.
+
The *Settings* page displays entries for applications that use the OAuth
protocol. 

. For each connection that requires configuration and that accesses an
application that uses the OAuth protocol, register your {prodname}
environment with the application. The steps vary for each application.

image:images/tutorials/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Three Vertical Dots] and
select *Edit*. 
. In the upper right, click *Save* or, if you want to start
running the imported integration, click *Publish*. Regardless of whether
you save the integration as a draft or you publish the integration, 
{prodname} updates the integration to use the updated connections.
