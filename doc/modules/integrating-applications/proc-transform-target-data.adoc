= Transforming source or target data

In the data mapper, after you define a mapping, you can transform
any field in the mapping. 
Transforming a data field defines how you want to store the data. 
For example, you could specify the *Capitalize* transformation to ensure that the first
letter of a data value is uppercase.

*Note:* If you want to add a condition to a mapping, you need to place any transformations within the conditional expression as described in link:{LinkSyndesisIntegrationGuide}#applying-conditions-to-mappings_map[Applying conditions to mappings].

.Procedure

. Map the fields. This can be a one-to-one mapping, a combination mapping,
or a separation mapping.
. In the *Mapping Details* panel, under *Sources* or under *Targets*, 
in the box for the field that you want to transform, click image:images/integrating-applications/transformation-icon.png[the Transformation icon]. This option displays a drop-down list of available transformations.
. Select the transformation that you want the data mapper to perform.
. If the transformation requires any input parameters, specify them
in the appropriate input fields.
. To add another transformation, click image:images/integrating-applications/transformation-icon.png[the Transformation icon] again.
