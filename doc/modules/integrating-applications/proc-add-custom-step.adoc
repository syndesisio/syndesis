= Adding a custom step

If {prodname} does not provide a step that you need in a flow,
a developer can define one or more custom steps in an extension. A custom
step operates on data between connections in a flow. 

You add a custom step to a flow in the same way that you add
a built-in step. For a simple integration, choose the start and finish
connections, add other connections as needed and then add additional steps.
For an API provider integration, select the operation whose flow executes
the custom step, add connections as needed to the flow, and then add other steps.
When you add a step, {prodname} operates on the data it receives from the
previous step(s) in the flow.

.Prerequisites
* You uploaded the custom step extension to {prodname}. See 
link:{LinkSyndesisIntegrationGuide}#making-extensions-available_add-extension[Making custom features available].
* You are creating or editing a flow.
* The flow already has all the connections that it requires.

.Procedure

. In the flow visualization, where you want to add a custom step, click the
image:images/integrating-applications/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign'].

. Click the custom step that you want to add.
+
The available steps includes any
custom steps that are defined in extensions that were uploaded to
your {prodname} environment.

. Respond to prompts for any information that is required to perform the step.
This information varies for each custom step.
