= Creating an API provider integration

To create an API provider integration, provide
an OpenAPI document (`.json`, `.yaml`, or `.yml` file) that defines the operations that the integration
can perform. {prodname} creates an execution flow for each operation.
Edit the flow for each operation to
add connections and steps that
process integration data according to the requirements for that operation.

.Prerequisites
* You are able to provide or define an OpenAPI document for the REST API
operations that you want the integration to perform.
+
To experiment,
link:{syndesis-quickstart-url}/api-provider/task-api.json[download the raw version of the `task-api.json` file],
which is an OpenAPI document for an API provider quickstart. You can
upload this file when {prodname} prompts you to provide an OpenAPI
document. Alternatively, you can specify the URL for the raw `task-api.json` file,
which is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syndesisio/syndesis-quickstarts/1.8/api-provider/task-api.json[].
* You have a plan for the flow for each OpenAPI operation.
* You created a connection for each application or service that you want
to add to an operation's flow.

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left navigation panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the upper right, click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a connection* page, click *API Provider*.
. On the *Start integration with an API call* page:
+
* If you have an OpenAPI 2.0 document that defines the REST API
operations, upload the OpenAPI document.
* If you need to define the OpenAPI 2.0 document, select *Create*.

. Click *Next*.
+
* If you uploaded a document, review or edit it:
+
.. Click *Review/Edit* to open the API Designer editor.
.. Review and edit as needed.
.. In the upper right, click *Save* or *Cancel* to close the editor.
.. Click *Next*.

* If you are creating a document, then in the API Designer editor
that {prodname} opens:
+
.. Define the OpenAPI document.
.. In the upper right, click *Save*, which closes the editor.
.. Click *Next*.

+
For information about using the API editor, see
link:{LinkDesigningAPIs}#create-api-definition[Designing and developing an API definition with API Designer].

.Result
{prodname} displays a list of the operations that the OpenAPI
document defines.

.Next step
For each operation,
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#define-integration-operation-flows_api-provider[define a flow that executes that operation].
