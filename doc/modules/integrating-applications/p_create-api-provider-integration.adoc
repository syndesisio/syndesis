= Creating an API provider integration

To create an API provider integration, provide
an OpenAPI document (`.json`, `.yaml`, or `.yml` file) that defines the operations that the integration
can perform. {prodname} creates an execution flow for each operation. 
Edit the flow for each operation to 
add connections and steps that 
process integration data according to the requirements for that operation. 

.Prerequisites
* You are able to provide or define an OpenAPI document for the REST API
operations that you want the integration to perform. 
+
To experiment,
link:{syndesis-quickstart-url}/api-provider/task-api.json[download the `task-api.json` file], 
which is an OpenAPI document for an API provider quickstart. You can
upload this file when {prodname} prompts you to provide an OpenAPI
document. 
* You have a plan for the flow for each OpenAPI operation. 
* You created a connection for each application or service that you want
to add to an operation's flow. 

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left navigation panel, click *Integrations*. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Integration*. 
. On the *Choose a connection* page, click *API Provider*. 
. On the *Start integration with an API call* page: 
+ 
* If you have an OpenAPI 2.0 document that defines the REST API 
operations, upload the OpenAPI document. 
* If you need to define the OpenAPI 2.0 document, select *Create*. 

. Click *Next*. 
+
* If you uploaded a document, review or edit it: 
+
.. Click *Review/Edit* to open the API Designer editor.
.. Review and edit as needed.
.. In the upper right, click *Save* or *Cancel* to close the editor.
.. Click *Next*. 

* If you are creating a document, then in the API Designer editor 
that {prodname} opens:
+
.. Define the OpenAPI document.
.. In the upper right, click *Save*, which closes the editor. 
.. Click *Next*. 

+
For information about using the API editor, see 
link:{LinkDesigningAPIs}#create-api-definition[Designing and developing an API definition with API Designer].

.Result
{prodname} displays a list of the operations that the OpenAPI
document defines. 

.Next step
For each operation,
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#create-integration-operation-flows_api-provider[define a flow that executes that operation].
