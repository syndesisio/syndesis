= Identifying where data mapping is needed

{prodname} displays warning icons to indicate where a flow 
requires data mapping. 

.Prerequisites
* You are creating or editing a flow.
* The flow contains all connections that it requires. 

.Procedure

. In the flow visualization, look for any
image:images/tutorials/WarningIcon.png[Warning] icons.

. Click the icon to see the *Data Type Mismatch* notification. 

. In the message, click *Add a data mapping step*, which displays
the data mapper.
. After adding the required data mapper steps, the image:images/tutorials/WarningIcon.png[Warning] icon can be still displayed (can display anytime during the editing process) due to the following reasons. 
+
* One of the source steps has changed it’s output

* The target step’s input is not compatible with the mapper’s output

* One of the source steps is missing

* The target step is missing
+
In this scenario, this warning indicates that the data mapper step added above must be edited.
