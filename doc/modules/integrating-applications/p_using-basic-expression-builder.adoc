= Using the basic expression builder to specify conditions

In a flow, add a *Conditional Flows* step when you want to evaluate
incoming data to determine the integration's execution path. The procedure
described here shows how to use the basic expression builder to 
specify conditions. 

.Prerequisites

* You are creating or editing a primary flow. If this is a simple integration, 
the start and finish connections have been added.  
* Input to a *Conditional Flows* step
must be an individual message. In the integration visualization, 
if the previous step's *Data Type* shows *(Collection)*, add a *Split* step
after the previous step and before this *Conditional Flows* step.  
* You are familiar with the fields that will be in the messages that the 
integration passes to the *Conditional Flows* step you are about to add.  

.Procedure

. In the integration visualization, where you want to add a *Conditional Flows* step,
click image:images/integrating-applications/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign'].
. Click *Conditional Flows*.
. Click *Select* in the *Basic expression builder* entry.
. In the *Configure Conditional Flows* page, define one or more conditions: 
.. Click in the initial *When* field.
.. In the list of properties, click the property that contains the 
content that you want the *Conditional Flows* step to evaluate. 
.. In the next field, accept *Contains* as the condition for which 
the step evaluates the data or select another condition. 
The condition that you select in this field must evaluate to 
true for the value that you enter in the next field.
.. In the third field, specify the value that the condition tests for. 
.. Optional. Click *Add another condition* to specify another condition. 
.. Repeat this set of steps for each additional condition that you want to define.
.. Optional. Change the order in which the integration evaluates
the defined conditions by clicking the up or down arrow to the right of a 
condition. 
 
.. Optional. Click *Execute default flow* if you want there to be a 
default conditional flow. 
+
If you select *Execute default flow*, during execution, 
if none of the conditions that you specified evaluates
to true, the integration executes the default conditional flow. If you do
not select *Execute default flow*, during execution, if none of the 
conditions that you specified evaluates to true, the integration continues 
execution with the step that follows this *Conditional Flows* step. 

. Click *Next*. 
. Optional. Specify the output data type if {prodname} prompts for it.
All conditional flows that are part of this *Conditional Flows* step
must have the same output type. 

. Click *Next*.
+
{prodname} displays the flow visualization. Below the *Conditional Flows* step
that you are adding, there is an entry for each condition that you specified, 
as well as an entry for an *Otherwise* default flow if you indicated that the 
*Conditional Flows* step has a default flow. 

.Next step

For each condition, add steps to its associated flow. If there is a default flow, 
add steps to the default flow.

for each condition, see

Note that the *matches* condition corresponds to the Simple Language
*regex* operator.
