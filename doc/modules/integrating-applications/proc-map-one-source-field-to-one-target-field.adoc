= Mapping one source field to one target field

The default mapping behavior maps one source field to one target field.
For example, map the `Name` field to the `CustomerName` field.

.Procedure

. In the *Sources* panel:

.. If necessary, expand a step to see the data fields that it
provides.
+
When there are many source fields, you can search for the
field of interest by clicking the
image:images/tutorials/magnifying-glass.png[Magnifying Glass] and then typing
the name of the data field in the search field.

.. Click the data field that you want to map from and then click image:images/integrating-applications/create-mapping-icon.png[the Create New Mapping icon]. The *Mapping Details* panel opens. 

. In the *Target* panel, find the data field that you want to map to and then click image:images/integrating-applications/connect-mapping-icon.png[the Connect Mapping icon].
+
The data mapper displays a line that connects the two fields that you just
selected.

. Optionally, preview the data mapping result. This option is useful when 
you add a transformation to the mapping or when the mapping requires
a type conversion. 
.. In the upper right of the data mapper, click 
image:images/integrating-applications/preview-mapping-icon.png[the Show/Hide Preview Mapping icon] to display a text input field on the source
field and a read-only result field on the target field. 
.. In the source field's data input field, type an example input value.  The mapping result appears in the read-only field on the target field.  
.. Optionally, to see the result of a transformation, add a transformation
in the *Mapping Details* panel. 

.. To hide the preview fields click image:images/integrating-applications/preview-mapping-icon.png[the Show/Hide Preview Mapping icon] again.

. Optionally, to confirm that the mapping is defined, click
image:images/tutorials/grid.png[the Mapping Table icon] to display the defined mappings.

+
You can also preview data mapping results in this view. 
.. If preview fields are not visible, 
click image:images/integrating-applications/preview-mapping-icon.png[the Show/Hide Preview Mapping icon].  
.. Enter data as described in the previous step.
+
In the table of defined mappings, preview fields appear for only the selected mapping. 

.. To see preview fields for another mapping, select it. 
.. Click image:images/integrating-applications/column-mapper-icon.png[the Column Mapper icon] again to display the data field panels. 

. In the upper right, click *Done* to add the data mapper step to the integration. 

// not supported in latest release
// .Alternative procedure
//Here is another way to map a single source field to a single target
//field:
//
//. In the *Configure Mapper* page, in the upper right, click the plus sign
//to display the *Mapping Details* panel. 
//. In the *Sources* section, enter
//the name of the source field. 
//. In the *Action* section, accept the
//default *Map* action. 
//. In the *Target* section, enter the name of the
//field that you want to map to and click *Enter*. 

.Troubleshooting tip
The data mapper displays the largest possible set of source fields that can 
be provided by the previous integration step. However, not all connections 
provide data in each displayed source field. For example, a change to a 
third-party application might discontinue providing data in a particular field. 
As you create an integration, if you notice that data mapping is not behaving 
as you expect, ensure that the source field that you want to map contains the 
data that you expect.
