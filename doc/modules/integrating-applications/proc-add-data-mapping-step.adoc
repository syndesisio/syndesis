= Adding a data mapper step

Almost all integrations require data mapping. A data mapper step 
maps data fields from the previous
connection(s) and any other steps to data fields that the 
next connection in the flow 
can operate on. For example,
suppose the integration data contains a `Name` field and the next
connection in the flow has a `CustomerName` field. You need to
map the source `Name` field to the target `CustomerName` field.

[IMPORTANT]
The data mapper displays the largest possible set of source fields that can 
be provided by the previous integration step. However, not all connections 
provide data in each displayed source field. For example, a change to a 
third-party application might discontinue providing data in a particular field. 
As you create an integration, if you notice that data mapping is not behaving 
as you expect, ensure that a source field that you want to map contains the 
data that you expect.

.Prerequisite

You are creating or editing a flow. 

.Procedure

. In the flow visualization, where you want to add a data mapper step,
click the image:images/integrating-applications/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign'].
. Click *Data Mapper* to display source
and target fields in the data mapper canvas. 

.Next step

See  link:{LinkSyndesisIntegrationGuide}#mapping-data_ug[Mapping integration data to fields for the next connection].
