= About connection validation

After obtaining authorization for {prodname} to access an application
that uses OAuth, you can create one or more connections
to that application.
When you create a connection to an OAuth application, 
{prodname} validates it to confirm that
authorization is in place. At any time, you can validate the connection again to
ensure that authorization is still in place.

Some OAuth applications grant access tokens that have an expiration date. 
If the access token expires, you can reconnect to the application to
obtain a new access token.

To validate a connection that uses OAuth or to obtain a new access token
for an OAuth application:

. In the left panel, click *Connections*.
. Click the connection that you want to validate or for which you want to
obtain a new access token.
. In the connection's details page, click *Validate* or click
*Reconnect*. 

If validation or reconnection fails, then check with the application/service provider to
determine if the application's OAuth keys, IDs, tokens, or secrets are still
valid. It is possible that an item has expired or been revoked.

If you find that an OAuth item is invalid, has expired, or been
revoked, obtain new values and paste them into the {prodname} settings
for the application. See the instructions in 
link:{LinkSyndesisConnectorGuide}[{NameOfSyndesisConnectorGuide}] 
for registering the application whose connection did not validate. With the
updated settings in place, follow the instructions above to try to
validate the updated connection. If validation is successful, and there
is a running integration that is using this connection, restart
the integration. To restart an integration, stop it and then start it.

If validation fails and reconnection fails but everything appears to 
be valid at the service provider, then try reregistering
your {prodname} environment with the application and then recreate the
connection. {prodname} validates the connection when you recreate it.
If you recreate the connection, and there is an integration that is
using the connection, then you must edit the integration to delete the old
connection and add the new connection. If the integration is running,
then you must stop it and restart it.
