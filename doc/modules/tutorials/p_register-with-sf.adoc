= Registering {prodname} as a Salesforce client application

In an integration, to connect to Salesforce, the first thing you must do is
register your {prodname} environment as a client application
that can access Salesforce.
This lets you create any number of integrations that connect
to Salesforce. In other words, you need to register a particular
{prodname} environment with Salesforce only once.

In each {prodname} environment, there can be only one registration
of {prodname} as a Salesforce client application. However, while each Salesforce
connection uses the same registration, it can use different user
credentials.

client and created a Salesforce connection, skip to
