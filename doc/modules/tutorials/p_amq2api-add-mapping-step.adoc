= Adding a data mapping step

To continue creating the AMQ to REST API sample integration, you need to add a 
data mapping step. This step correlates the `task` field in the
output from the damage reporter step to the `task` field in the
database that the REST API accesses. 

.Prerequisite
* You added the Damage Reporter step to the integration. 

.Procedure
. In {prodname}, in the integration visualization, 
click the plus sign that is between the Damage Reporter
step and the finish connection.
. Click *Data Mapper*. In the data mapper,
the *Source* panel on the left displays the fields in the
output from the damage reporter step. The
*Target* panel on the right displays the fields in the database that
the API accesses.
. In the *Source* panel, click the `task` field.
. In the *Target* panel, expand the `body` field and click `task`.
. In the upper right, click *Done*.

.Result
The integration is complete and it is ready to be published. 
On the left, in the integration visualization panel, you might see a
image:../..//images/tutorials/WarningIcon.png[warning] Data Type Mismatch 
warning icon. You can ignore it.
