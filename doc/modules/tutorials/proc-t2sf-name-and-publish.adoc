= Giving the integration a name and deploying it

When the Twitter to Salesforce sample integration is complete then you
can deploy it and see how it works. 

.Prerequisites
* The integration's start connection is Twitter.
* The integration's finish connection is Salesforce. 
* The integration has a filter step.
* You just added a data mapping step to the integration. 

.Procedure
. In the upper right corner, click *Publish*.
. In the *Name* field,
enter a name of your choice that distinguishes this integration
from any other integrations. For
example: `*Twitter to Salesforce Sample Integration*`.
. Optionally, in the *Description* field, enter information that might be
helpful to know about this integration.
. Optionally, in the *Labels* field, add one or more labels. A label is a key-value pair tag that you can apply to an integration for later filtering and selecting in OpenShift. For example, an OpenShift admin user can filter the list of running pods or deployments by label.
. Click *Save and publish*.

+
{prodname} starts to deploy the integration and then displays the 
integration summary. Near the top, you can see a progress 
indicator that shows the publishing stages. 
{prodname} is generating the runtime for the integration and
will start it when the runtime is ready. This takes a few minutes.
+
A {prodname} account is limited to a specific number of 
integrations that can be running at one time. For details, 
see the pricing plan. If you are already running the maximum
number of integrations, then you must stop an integration
before you can start running another one. 

. If you are already running the maximum number of integrations, follow
these steps to stop an integration:

.. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
.. In the entry for the integration that you want to stop, click
image:images/tutorials/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right. 
.. In the popup, click *Stop*. 

. After stopping an integration, start another integration as follows:

.. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
.. In the entry for the integration that you want to start, click
image:images/tutorials/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right. 
.. In the popup, click *Start*.
