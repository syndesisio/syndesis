= Choosing the finish connection

In {prodname}, to continue creating the Salesforce to database sample
integration, after you add the start connection, you add the finish connection 
to the integration.
 
.Prerequisites
* You added the Salesforce connection to the integration as the start connection. 
* {prodname} is prompting you to add the finish connection. 

.Procedure
. In {prodname}, on the *Choose a connection* page,
click the  *PostgresDB* connection.
This integration finishes by using the credentials
defined in this database connection to connect to the
provided sample database.
+
*Note:* If you do not see the *PostgreDB* connection card, your OpenShift administrator must configure {prodname} to include the sample PostgresDB connection (and the ToDo app).    

. On the *Choose an action* page, select *Invoke stored procedure*,
which passes data to a stored procedure.

. In the *Procedure name* field, accept *add_lead*, which is the
provided stored procedure to run in the sample database.
The selected procedure determines the requirements for additional
steps in the integration, for example, which Salesforce data fields
need to be mapped to which database fields.

. Click *Next* to add the finish connection to the integration.
