= Adding a data mapping step

To continue creating the Salesforce to database sample integration,
add a data mapping step that correlates Salesforce lead fields to
fields in the sample database. 

.Prerequisites
* The integration's start connection is to Salesforce.
* The integration's finish connection is to the PostgresDB sample database. 

.Procedure
. In {prodname}, in the integration visualization, click the plus sign. 
. Click *Data Mapper* and wait a few moments. When the data fields
appear, the *Sources* panel on the left displays the Salesforce fields
and the *Target* panel on the right displays the database fields.

. Map the Salesforce `Company` field to the
database `company` field:
.. On the left, in the *Sources* panel, click *Company*.
.. On the right, in the *Target* panel, click *company*.
The data mapper displays a line
from the source field to the target field.
. Map the *Sources* (Salesforce) `Email` field to the *Target* (database)
`email` field.
. Map two Salesforce fields (`FirstName` and `LastName`) to the database
`first_and_last_name` field:
.. In the *Target* panel, click *first_and_last_name*.
.. In the *Sources* panel, click *FirstName*.
.. In the *Sources* panel, hover over *LastName* and 
press *CTRL-Mouse1* (*CMD-Mouse1* on MacOS).
+
When you are done you should see a line from each of the source fields to
the target field. 

. Add the following mappings:
