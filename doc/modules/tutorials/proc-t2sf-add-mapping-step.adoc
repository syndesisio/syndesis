= Adding a data mapping step

To continue creating the Twitter to Salesforce sample integration,
add a data mapping step that correlates Twitter mention fields to
Salesforce contact fields. 

.Prerequisites
* The integration's start connection is to Twitter.
* The integration's finish connection is to Salesforce. 
* You just added the filter step between the two connections. 

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the integration visualization, click the plus sign that is between the filter
step and the finish connection.
. Click *Data Mapper* and wait a few moments. When the data fields
appear, the *Sources* panel on the left displays the Twitter fields
and the *Target* panel on the right displays the Salesforce fields.
. Map the Twitter `name` field to the Salesforce
`FirstName` and `LastName` fields:
.. In the *Sources* panel, click the magnifying
glass image:images/tutorials/magnifying-glass.png[title="Magnifying Glass"]
to display the search field and enter `*name*`.
.. Under the `user` folder, click the `name` field and then click the *Create New Mapping* icon.
.. In the *Mapping Details* panel, in the *Targets* field, type *FirstName* to filter the list of target fields and then select */FirstName*. The data mapper displays a line from the source *name* field to the target *FirstName* field.    
.. In the *Mapping Details* panel, in the *Targets* field, type *LastName* to filter the list of target fields and then select */LastName*.
+                 
The data mapper displays another line from the Twitter
*name* field, but this time it goes to the Salesforce *LastName* field.
The blue lines indicate the current focus.

[NOTE]
====
If you accidentally map the wrong fields then delete the incorrect mapping by clicking the trash can icon in the data mapperâ€™s *Mapping Details* panel.

. Map the Twitter `screenName` field to the Salesforce
`Title` field:
.. In the *Sources* panel, click
the *screenName* field.
.. On the right, at the top of the *Target* panel,
click the magnifying
glass image:images/tutorials/magnifying-glass.png[title="Magnifying Glass"]
to display the search field and enter `*Title*`.
.. Click the *Title* field. The data mapper displays a line
from the Twitter *screenName* field to the Salesforce *Title* field.
. Map the Twitter `text` field to the Salesforce
`Description` field:
.. In the *Sources* search field, enter `*text*` and click the
 *text* field.
 Be sure to click the toplevel *text* field. Do not click one of 
 the *text* fields that is contained in the *user* field.
.. In the *Target* search field, enter `*description*`.
.. Click the
Salesforce *Description* field to create the mapping.
. In the upper right, click
the grid icon image:images/tutorials/grid.png[title="Grid"] to
display the list of mappings, which should look like this:

. In the upper right, click *Done*.
