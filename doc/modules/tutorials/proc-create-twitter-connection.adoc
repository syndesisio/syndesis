= Creating a Twitter connection

To create an integration that obtains data from Twitter, you 
must first create a Twitter connection.  
After you create a Twitter connection, you can use it in any number of  
integrations.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to {prodname}. 
ifeval::["{location}" == "downstream"]
The URL for accessing {prodname} is in the 
email message that welcomed you to the Red Hat Fuse Online Evaluation program. 
endif::[]
* {prodname} is open in a web browser. 
* You registered your {prodname} environment as an application
that can access Twitter.
* You added the Twitter consumer API key and consumer API secret key that you received
after registration to the {prodname} *Settings* page. 


.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to
display any available connections.
. Click *Create Connection* to display
the available connectors. A connector is a template that
you use to create one or more connections.
. Click the *Twitter* connector.
. Click *Connect Twitter* to display a Twitter authorization page.
You might need to log in to Twitter before you see the authorization page.
+
If *Connect Twitter* does not appear, then your {prodname} environment
is not registered as a Twitter client application. See
link:{LinkSyndesisConnectorGuide}#register-with-twitter_twitter[Registering {prodname} as a Twitter client application].
When you try to create a Twitter connection and your {prodname} environment 
is not registered as a Twitter client application, then {prodname} displays
multiple fields that prompt for authorization information. While you can
create a Twitter connection by entering values in these fields, 
it is not recommended. 

. Click *Authorize app* to return to {prodname}.
. In the *Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections.
For example, enter `*Twitter Connect 1*`.
. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. For example,
enter `*Sample Twitter connection
that uses my Twitter login credentials.*`
. Click *Save* to see that the connection you
created is now available. If you entered the example name, you would
see that *Twitter Connect 1* appears as a connection that you can 
choose to add to an integration.
