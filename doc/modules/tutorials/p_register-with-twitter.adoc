= Registering {prodname} as a Twitter client application

In an integration, to connect to Twitter, the first thing you must do is
register your {prodname} environment as a client application
that can access Twitter.
This lets you create any number of integrations that connect
to Twitter. In other words, you need to register a particular
{prodname} environment with Twitter only once.

In each {prodname} environment, there can be only one registration
of {prodname} as a Twitter client application. However, while each Twitter
connection uses the same registration, it can use different user
credentials. 

.Prerequisite
You are logged in to {prodname}. 
ifeval::["{location}" == "downstream"]
The URL for accessing {prodname} is in the 
email message that welcomed you to the Red Hat Fuse Online Evaluation program.

.. In the left panel, click *Settings*.
.. On the *Settings* page, near the top, to the right of the callback URL, click

of this procedure and remove `api/v1/credentials/callback` from the end
of the URL.

something like this:
