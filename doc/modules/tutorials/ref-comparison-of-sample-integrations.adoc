|What it does
|Captures and filters tweets that mention
a particular Twitter user. For tweets that contain specified text, 
the integration passes data related to the tweet to Salesforce
and Salesforce creates a new contact.
|Captures updates in Salesforce and then calls a database
stored procedure to synchronize a particular database table
with the Salesforce updates.
|Obtains delivery records from a Red Hat AMQ broker, executes
a custom step to identify any
items that were damaged when they were received, and 
connects to a REST API to provide contact information for vendors of
damaged items.

|What you learn about
|Connecting to Twitter and Salesforce, how {prodname} interfaces with
applications that use the OAuth 
protocol, mapping data fields received from one application to fields that
the next connected application in the integration can operate on, filtering data
to determine whether to continue integration execution. 
|Connecting to Salesforce and a SQL database, OAuth support, data mapping, 
how to update a SQL database as part of an integration.
|Connecting to a Red Hat AMQ broker and a REST API, data mapping, 
uploading extensions for a step and for a REST API client
connector, using a custom step and a custom API client connection.

|Notes about the time
|This includes the time needed to obtain Twitter and Salesforce accounts.
It does not include 5 - 12 minutes of waiting for Salesforce registration to take effect
and for {prodname} to start running the integration.
|20 minutes includes the time needed to obtain a Salesforce developer account
but not the time spent waiting.
If you already created the Twitter to Salesforce sample then it takes 
10 minutes to create this integration.
|This does not include the time it takes for {prodname} to start running the integration.
