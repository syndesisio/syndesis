= Enable access to the Gmail API

To be able to connect to Gmail in an integration, 
you must register your {prodname} environment as a Google client application. 
During registration, you enable the Gmail API and create credentials that
{prodname} uses to access Google APIs that you have enabled.  

If you already created a connection to Google Calendar, then 
{prodname} has the credentials for access to enabled Google
APIs. To be able to create a Gmail connection, you just need to
enable the Gmail API and then in the {prodname} *Settings* page,
copy the Google Calendar client ID and client secret to the Gmail
settings for client ID and client secret.

If you already registered your {prodname} environment as a Google client 
application and during registration you enabled the Gmail API, then you do
not need to follow the procedure provided here. You are ready to
create a Gmail connection. 

.Prerequisite
In the *Settings* page in your {prodname} environment, the Google
Calendar entry displays *Edit* and *Remove*, which
indicate that {prodname} has the credentials to access 
enabled Google APIs. If *Register* appears in the Google
Calendar entry and the Gmail entry, then you must
