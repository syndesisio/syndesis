= Obtain a particular event from a Google calendar

In an integration, you can obtain a particular Google Calendar event
in the middle of an integration. Obtaining a particular event is 
useful, for example, when you want to:

* Update the event in a subsequent Google Calendar connection.
* Announce the event by using a subsequent Twitter connection. 

To obtain one event, add a Google Calendar connection in the middle of 
an integration.

NOTE: In this release, while obtaining a specific event in an integration's 
finish connection is supported, it is not particularly useful. This is 
expected to change in a future release.

.Prerequisites
* A Google Calendar connection is available and this connection
is authorized to access the Google calendar that has the 
event that you want to get.

* You are creating or editing an integration and {prodname} is prompting you 
to select the connection that you want to add
in the middle of an integration. 

.Procedure

. Click a Google Calendar connection that is authorized to access
the calendar that you want to connect to.   
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Get a Specific Event*. 
. Specify the name of the caladd a finish connection or add a finish connection or endar that has the event that you want.
. Specify the ID of the event to get. To obtain the event ID, do one of the 
following:
+
* Map it from a previous Google Calendar connection. 
* Manually obtain it from the calendar as follows: 
+
.. In a browser, display the calendar that contains the event you want to get. 
.. Append `?gsessionid=OK&eventdeb=1`to the URL and redisplay the calendar.
.. In the calendar, click the event that you want to get. 
.. In the event popup, click 
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Options] and select 
*Troubleshooting info*. 
.. In the popup that Google Calendar displays, copy the string that
follows *`eid=`*. For example, an event ID looks something like this: 
`p1pva2a4t504gbsha12di9ch6k_20181107T150000Z*`.

. Click *Done* to add the connection to the integration. 
The connection appears in the integration flow in the location 
where you added it.
