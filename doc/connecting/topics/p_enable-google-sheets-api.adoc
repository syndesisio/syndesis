= Enable access to the Google Sheets API

To be able to connect to Google Sheets in an integration,
you must register your {prodname} environment as a Google client application.
During registration, you enable the Google Sheets API and create credentials that
{prodname} uses to access Google APIs that you have enabled.

If you already created a connection to Gmail or Google Calendar, then
{prodname} has the credentials for access to enabled Google
APIs. To be able to create a Google Sheets connection, you just need to
enable the Google Sheets API and then copy {prodname} settings from Gmail or Google Calendar
to Google Sheets.

If you already registered your {prodname} environment as a Google client
application and during registration you enabled the Google Sheets API, then you do
not need to follow the procedure provided here. You are ready to
create a Google Sheets connection.

.Prerequisite
In the *Settings* page in your {prodname} environment, the Gmail or Google Calendar
entry displays *Edit* and *Remove*, which
indicate that {prodname} has the credentials to access
enabled Google APIs. If *Register* appears in the Gmail or Google Calendar
entry, then you must

.. Ensure that the current Google project is the one you used for
registration. If it is not, change to that project.
