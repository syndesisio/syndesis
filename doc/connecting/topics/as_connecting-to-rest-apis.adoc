= Connect to REST APIs
:context: rest

In an integration, to connect to a REST API, you must have created a
connector for that API by uploading an OpenAPI document that
describes the API. See 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#adding-api-connectors_add-client-connector[{NameOfFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}, Adding  REST API client connectors].

When a connector for the REST API you want to connect to
is available in {prodname},
the steps for connecting to that REST API are:

* <<register-with-rest-api_{context}>> if required
* <<create-rest-api-connection_{context}>>
* <<add-api-client-connection_{context}>>
