[id='start-with-webhook-connection_{context}']
= Create an integration that an HTTP request can trigger

To trigger execution of an integration with an HTTP `GET` or `POST` request,
add a Webhook connection as the integration's start connection. 

.Procedure

. In the {prodname} panel on the left, click *Integrations*.
. Click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click the Webhook connection.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click the *Incoming Webhook* action. 
+
In the *Webhook Configuration* page, {prodname} displays the webhook
token that {prodname} generates for this integration. 
+
When you construct the HTTP request, this token is the last part of the URL. 
After you publish this integration and it is running, {prodname} displays
the {prodname} external URL, which has this token at the end. 

. Click *Next*. 
. In the *Specify Output Data Type* page:
.. In the *Select Type* field, select *JSON schema*.
.. In the *Definition* field, paste the JSON schema that defines the data 
types of the parameters in the HTTP request. See 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#about-json-schema-for-http-requests_webhook[JSON schema for specifying request parameters]. 
.. In the *Data Type Name* field, specify a name for this data type. 
Although this is optional, if you specify a name, it appears in the 
data mapper *Sources* list, which can make it easier to correctly map fields. 
.. Optionally, in the *Data Type Description* field, provide some information 
that helps you distinguish this data type.
.. Click *Done*. 
. Add the finish connection to the integration. 
. Add any other needed connections.
. Immediately after the start connection, add a data mapper step. 
. Add any other needed steps. 
. Click *Publish*, give the integration a name and optionally, a description, 
and click *Publish* again.
