= Publish messages to AMQP in the middle of an integration

In the middle of an integration, to publish messages to an AMQP broker,
add an AMQP connection between the start and 
finish connections. 

.Prerequisites
* You created a connection to the AMQP broker that you want to publish 
messages to.
* You are creating or editing an integration. 
* You already added the start and finish connections to the
integration.

.Procedure

. In the integration visualization panel on the left, click the plus
sign in the location where you want to add the connection. 
. Click *Add a connection*. 

. On the *Choose a Connection* page, click the AMQP connection that you 
want the integration to use after the start connection and before 
the finish connection. 

. On the *Choose an Action* page, select one of the following actions:
+
* *Publish messages* to
publish messages to the queue or topic you specify. To configure this
action:
.. In the *Destination Name* field, enter the name of the queue or 
topic to send messages to. 
.. For the *Destination Type*, accept *Queue* or select *Topic*. 
.. Select *Persistent* to guarantee message delivery even if
a connection fails. 
+
* *Request response using messages* to send messages to the JMS destination
you specify and receive a response. To configure this action:

.. In the *Destination Name* field, enter the name of the queue or topic 
to send messages to. 
.. For the *Destination Type*, accept *Queue* or select *Topic*.
.. In the *Message Selector* field, if you want to receive only responses 
that satisfy a particular condition, enter a filter expression. 
+
A message selector is a string that contains an expression. The syntax of 
the expression is based on a subset of the SQL92 conditional expression syntax. 
The message selector in the following example selects any message that has a 
`NewsType` property whose value is set to `Sports` or `Opinion`:
+
`NewsType = ’Sports’ OR NewsType = ’Opinion’`
+
The message consumer receives only those messages whose headers and 
properties match the message selector expression. A message selector cannot select messages on 
the basis of the content of the message body.


.. In the *Named Reply To* field, enter the name of
a queue or topic. The destination sends its response
to this queue or topic. 
.. Select *Persistent* to guarantee message delivery even if
a connection fails.  
.. In the *Response Time Out* field, specify the number of milliseconds that this 
connection waits for a 
response message before throwing a runtime exception. 
The default is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).

. Click *Next* to specify the action's input and output type. 


. In the *Select Type* field, if the data type does not need to be known, 
accept *Type specification not required* 
and then, at the bottom, click *Done*. You do not need to follow the rest of these
instructions. 
+
Otherwise, select one of the following as the schema type:
+
* *JSON schema* is a document that describes the structure of JSON data.
The document's media type is `application/schema+json`. 
* *JSON instance* is a document that contains JSON data. The document's 
media type is `application/json`. 
* *XML schema* is a document that describes the structure of XML data.
The document's file extension is `.xsd`.
* *XML instance* is a document that contains XML data. The
document's file extension is `.xml`. 

. In the *Definition* input box, paste a definition that conforms to the
schema type you selected. 
For example, if you select *JSON schema* then you would paste the content of
a JSON schema file, which has a media type of `application/schema+json`.

. In the *Data Type Name* field, enter a name that you choose for the
data type. For example, suppose you are specifying a JSON schema for
vendors. You can specify `*Vendor*` as the data type name. 
+
You will see this data type name when you are creating 
or editing an integration that uses the connection
for which you are specifying this type. {prodname} displays the type name
in the integration visualization panel and in the data mapper. 

. In the *Data Type Description* field, provide information that helps you
distinguish this type. This description appears in the data mapper when 
you hover over the step that processes this type. 
. Click *Done*. 

.Result
The connection appears in the integration flow 
in the location where you added it.
