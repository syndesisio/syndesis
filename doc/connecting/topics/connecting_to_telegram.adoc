= Connect to Telegram

As a business user, you can create an integration that connects to Telegram. A 
connection to Telegram can do either one of the following:

* Trigger execution of the integration when a Telegram bot that you specify
receives a message. The integration passes the message to the next
step in the integration. For example, after an integration receives a 
message there might be a filter step that watches 
for keyword instances such as product names. Upon finding messages that
contain those product names, the integration can notify the appropriate contact 
in a Gmail connection or in a different Telegram connection. 

* Deliver a message to a particular Telegram chat. For example, this 
behavior is useful when an integration downloads a file from an FTP server and 
processes it in some way. You can finish an integration by 
notifying a Telegram chat that the process was successful.

To connect to Telegram in an integration, create a Telegram 
connection and then add the connection to an integration.
