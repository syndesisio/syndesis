= Start an integration by obtaining data from Amazon S3

To start an integration by obtaining data from an Amazon S3 bucket, 
add an Amazon S3 connection as the start connection in an integration.

.Prerequisite
You created an Amazon S3 connection.

.Procedure

. In the {prodname} panel on the left, click *Integrations*.
. Click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click the Amazon S3 connection that
you want to use to start the integration.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click the action that you
want the connection to perform:
* *Get Object* obtains a file from the bucket that the connection
accesses. In the *File Name* field, enter the name of the file that you want
to obtain. If the specified file is not in the bucket, it is a runtime error.

* *Poll an Amazon S3 Bucket* periodically obtains files from the bucket that the
connection accesses. To configure this action:
.. In the *Delay* field, accept the default of 500 milliseconds as the time
that elapses between polls. Or, to specify a different polling interval,
enter a number and select its time unit. 
.. In the *Maximum Objects to Retrieve* field, enter the largest number of files
that one poll operation can obtain. The default is 10.
+
To have no limit on the number of files that can be obtained, specify
`0` or a negative integer. When *Maximum Objects to Retrieve* is unlimited,
the poll action obtains all files in the bucket.
+
If the bucket contains more than the specified maximum number of files
then the action obtains the files that were most recently
modified or created. 
.. In the *Prefix* field, optionally specify a regular expression
that evaluates to a string. If you specify a
prefix then this action retrieves a file
only when its name starts with that string.

.. Indicate whether you want to  
*Obtain files and then delete them from the bucket*.

. After you configure the action, click *Done* to specify the action's output type. 


. In the *Select Type* field, if the data type does not need to be known, 
accept *Type specification not required* 
and then, at the bottom, click *Done*. You do not need to follow the rest of these
instructions. 
+
Otherwise, select one of the following as the schema type:
+
* *JSON schema* is a document that describes the structure of JSON data.
The document's media type is `application/schema+json`. 
* *JSON instance* is a document that contains JSON data. The document's 
media type is `application/json`. 
* *XML schema* is a document that describes the structure of XML data.
The document's file extension is `.xsd`.
* *XML instance* is a document that contains XML data. The
document's file extension is `.xml`. 

. In the *Definition* input box, paste a definition that conforms to the
schema type you selected. 
For example, if you select *JSON schema* then you would paste the content of
a JSON schema file, which has a media type of `application/schema+json`.

. In the *Data Type Name* field, enter a name that you choose for the
data type. For example, suppose you are specifying a JSON schema for
vendors. You can specify `*Vendor*` as the data type name. 
+
You will see this data type name when you are creating 
or editing an integration that uses the connection
for which you are specifying this type. {prodname} displays the type name
in the integration visualization panel and in the data mapper. 

. In the *Data Type Description* field, provide information that helps you
distinguish this type. This description appears in the data mapper when 
you hover over the step that processes this type. 
. Click *Done*. 

The connection appears in the integration flow 
in the location where you added it.
