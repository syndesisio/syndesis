= Register {prodname} as a Google client application

In an integration, to be able to connect to Gmail, Google Calendar, or
Google Sheets, 
you must register your {prodname} environment as a Google client application.
During registration, you enable Google APIs and create credentials that
{prodname} uses to access the Google APIs that you have enabled.

With registration in place, you can create any number of connections
to Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets. You can create any number of 
integrations that connect to these Google applications. 
While each connection to a Google application uses the
same client ID and client secret, which you obtain during registration, 
each connection can have the authorization to access
a different Google account, which you choose. 

This procedure instructs you to enable the Gmail API, the Google Calendar API, 
and the Google Sheets API. However, you can enable only the API(s) that you 
need rather than all three APIs. At a later time, if you need to create connections
to the applications whose APIs you did not enable, you can return here and 
follow the instructions to enable their APIs. 

.Prerequisite
You must be able to sign in to the Google account that you want to
use to register {prodname} as a Google client application.

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, do the following:
.. In the left navigation panel, click *Settings*.
.. On the *Settings* page, near the top, to the right of the callback URL,
click
image:shared/images/CopyCallback.png[Copy Callback URL] to
copy the callback URL for your {prodname} environment to the clipboard.
You will need this URL later in this procedure.
. In another browser tab, go to `https://console.developers.google.com`
and do the following:
.. Confirm that you are signed in to the Google account that you want to
use to register {prodname} as a Google client application.
Or, choose a different Google account and sign in to that account.
.. Ensure that you want to use the current Google project to grant
authorization to {prodname}. Or, choose or create another project.
If this Google account does not already
have a project, you must create one. For information about Google projects
and how you might want to organize your use of projects, click the Google help
icon in the upper right.
.. Enable Google APIs as follows:
... In the upper left corner, click 
image:images/Hamburger.png[Navigation menu icon] and select
*APIs and Services* > *Library*.
... If necessary, scroll down to see the *G Suite* row of cards. 
... Click the *Google Calendar API* card, which displays a page that indicates
that the Google Calendar API is enabled.  
... Scroll down and click the *Gmail API* card, which displays a page that indicates
that the Gmail API is enabled.
... In the upper left corner, click 
image:images/Hamburger.png[Navigation menu icon] and select
*APIs and Services* > *Library*.
... If necessary, scroll down to see the *G Suite* row of cards. 
... Click the *Google Sheets API* card, which displays a page that indicates
that the Google Sheets API is enabled.  
.. Give your client application a name as follows:
... Click *MANAGE*. 
... In the page that appears, in the left navigation panel, click
*Credentials* and then on the right, click *Credentials in APIs & Services*.
... Click the *OAuth consent screen* tab.
... In the page that appears, in the *Application Name* field, enter a name for the {prodname}
client application. For example, enter `*{prodname} client application*`.
... Skip the other fields.
... Click *Save*.
.. Obtain client application credentials as follows:
... To the right of *Create Credentials*, click the down arrow to
display a menu and select *OAuth client ID*.
... In the page that appears, select *Web application* to display more content.
... In the *Name* field, enter a name for the OAuth client ID for
your {prodname} environment. This is different from the name that you
entered for the client application itself. For example, enter
`OAuth client ID for {prodname}`.
... Skip *Authorized JavaScript origins*.
... In the *Authorized redirect URIs* field, paste the callback URL
that you copied from your {prodname} environment at the beginning of
this procedure. 
... Click *Create* to display the client ID and client secret for your
{prodname} environment.
.. To the right of the client ID field, click
image:images/copy_icon.png[the Copy icon] to copy the client ID
to your clipboard.

. Return to the {prodname} *Settings* page and do the following: 
.. Expand the entries for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Sheets. 
.. In the *Client ID* field for each Google application, 
paste the Google client ID that you just copied.

. Return to the Google developers site and to the right of the
client secret field, click
image:images/copy_icon.png[the Copy icon] to copy the client secret to
your clipboard.

. Return to the {prodname} *Settings* page and do the following in
the entry for each Google application: 
.. In the *Client Secret* field, paste the Google client secret that you
just copied.
.. Click *Save*. You should get a *Registration Successful!* notification.
.. Click *Ok* to collapse the entry.

.Results
For each Google application API that you enabled, you can create a 
connection to that application.

All connections from {prodname} to Google applications use the same Google 
client ID and Google client secret. 

[IMPORTANT]
The Google client ID and Google client secret contain token refresh
information that ensures that your connections to Google applications, and integrations
that have connections to Google applications continuously work correctly.
Consequently, you should *not* obtain new credentials. If you do, then you
would need to recreate each Google connection, replace the old
connections with new connections, and re-publish each
integration that uses a Google connection.
