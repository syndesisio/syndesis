experienced developer can create an extension that defines a custom
connector. For information about coding the

{prodname}, see 
link:{LinkToolingUserGuide}#IgniteExtension[{NameOfToolingUserGuide},Develop extensions for {prodname} integrations] and 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#developing-extensions_dev-extension[{NameOfFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}, Develop extensions].
