= Register {prodname} as a Google Calendar client application

In an integration, to be able to connect to Google Calendar, 
you must register your {prodname} environment as a  Google client application. 
During registration, you enable the Google
Calendar API and create credentials that {prodname} uses to access
Google APIs that you have enabled. 

With registration in place, you can create any number of Google
Calendar connections and any number of integrations that connect
to Google Calendar. While each Google Calendar connection uses the 
same registration, each connection can 
access the calendars that belong to a different Google account. 

[NOTE]
If you already created a Gmail connection, then you already 
created the credentials that your {prodname} environment needs to access
enabled Google APIs. You do not need to follow the procedure documented here.
To be able to create a Google Calendar connection, you just need to

and then copy {prodname} settings from Gmail to Google Calendar.

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, obtain the callback URL as follows: 
.. In the left navigation panel, click *Settings*. 
.. On the *Settings* page, near the top, to the right of the callback URL, 
click
image:shared/images/CopyCallback.png[Copy Callback URL] to 
copy the callback URL for your {prodname} environment to the clipboard. 
You will need this URL later in this procedure. 
. In another browser tab, go to `https://console.developers.google.com` 
and do the following:
.. Confirm that you are signed in to the Google account that you want to
use to register {prodname} as a Google client application. 
Or, choose a different Google account and sign in to that account. 
.. Ensure that you want to use the current Google project to grant
authorization to {prodname}. Or, choose or create another project. 
If this Google account does not already
have a project, you must create one. For information about Google projects
and how you might want to organize your use of projects, click the Google help
icon in the upper right. 
.. You should see the *APIs and Services* dashboard. If you do not, then
in the upper left corner, click the
image:images/Hamburger.png[Navigation menu icon] and select
*APIs and Services* > *Dashboard*. 
.. Enable the Google Calendar API as follows:
... At the top of the page, click *ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES*. 
... In the page that appears, in the search field, enter `*Google Calendar*`. 
... In the search results, click the *Google Calendar* card. 
... In the *Google Calendar API* page, click *ENABLE*.
.. Give your client application a name as follows:
... In the page that appears, in the left navigation panel, click 
*Credentials* and then on the right, click *Credentials in APIs & Services*.
... Click the *OAuth consent screen* tab. 
... In the page that appears, in the *Application Name* field, enter a 
name for the {prodname}
client application. For example, enter `*{prodname} client application*`. 
... Skip the other fields. 
... Click *Save*. 
.. Obtain client application credentials as follows: 
... To the right of *Create Credentials*, click the down arrow to 
display a menu and select *OAuth client ID*. 
... In the page that appears, select *Web application* to display more content.
... In the *Name* field, enter a name for the OAuth client ID for 
your {prodname} environment. This is different from the name that you 
entered for the client application itself. For example, enter 
`OAuth client ID for {prodname}`. 
... Skip *Authorized JavaScript origins*. 
... In the *Authorized redirect URIs* field, paste the callback URL 
that you copied from your {prodname} environment at the beginning of 
this procedure. 
... Click *Create* to display the client ID and client secret for your 
{prodname} environment. 
.. To the right of the client ID field, click
image:images/copy_icon.png[the Copy icon] to copy the client ID
to your clipboard.

. Return to the {prodname} *Settings* page, expand the Google Calendar entry, 
and in the Google Calendar *Client ID* field, 
paste the consumer client ID that you just copied. 

. Return to the Google developers site and to the right of the 
client secret field, click 
image:images/copy_icon.png[the Copy icon] to copy the client secret to
your clipboard.

. Return to the {prodname} *Settings* page and do the following: 
.. In the Google Calendar *Client Secret* field, paste the Google Calendar 
client secret that you just copied. 
.. Click *Save*. You should get a *Registration Successful!* notification. 	
.. Click *Ok* to collapse the fields. 

.Results
You can now create a Google Calendar connection. 

[IMPORTANT]
The Google client ID and Google client secret contain token refresh 
information that ensures that  your Google Calendar connections and integrations 
that have Google Calendar connections continuously work correctly.
Consequently, you should *not* obtain new credentials. If you do, then you
would need to recreate each Google Calendar connection and re-publish each
integration that uses a Google Calendar connection.
