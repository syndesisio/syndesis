= Add data to Amazon S3 in the middle of an integration

In the middle of an integration, to add data to Amazon S3, 
add an Amazon S3 connection between the start and
finish connections of an integration.

.Prerequisite
You created an Amazon S3 connection.

.Procedure

. Add the start and finish connections.
. In the left panel, hover over the plus sign that is in the location
where you want to add the Amazon S3 connection.
. In the pop-up, click *Add a Connection*.
. Click the Amazon S3 connection that you want to use as a middle
connection in the integration.
. Click the action that you want the connection to perform:
.. *Copy Object* adds one or more objects to the bucket. 
+
To add one file to the bucket, you can enter its name in the *File Name* field.
+
To add multiple files to the bucket, do not specify a file name.
In this case, the action adds all objects that it 
obtains from the previous integration step(s). 
+
If you used the poll action
to obtain multiple files and you specify a file name then the *Copy Object*
action adds only the last file that was received from the poll action. 

.. *Delete Object* deletes an object from the bucket. In the
*File Name* field, specify the name of the object that you want to delete.
If the specified file is not in the bucket, the integration continues 
with no error. 

. After you configure the chosen action, click *Next* to specify 
the action's input type. 

. In the *Select Type* field, if the data type does not need to be known, 
accept *Type specification not required* 
and then, at the bottom, click *Done*. You do not need to follow the rest of these
instructions. 
+
Otherwise, select one of the following as the schema type:
+
* *JSON schema* is a document that describes the structure of JSON data.
The document's media type is `application/schema+json`. 
* *JSON instance* is a document that contains JSON data. The document's 
media type is `application/json`. 
* *XML schema* is a document that describes the structure of XML data.
The document's file extension is `.xsd`.
* *XML instance* is a document that contains XML data. The
document's file extension is `.xml`. 

. In the *Definition* input box, paste a definition that conforms to the
schema type you selected. 
For example, if you select *JSON schema* then you would paste the content of
a JSON schema file, which has a media type of `application/schema+json`.

. In the *Data Type Name* field, enter a name that you choose for the
data type. For example, suppose you are specifying a JSON schema for
vendors. You can specify `*Vendor*` as the data type name. 
+
You will see this data type name when you are creating 
or editing an integration that uses the connection
for which you are specifying this type. {prodname} displays the type name
in the integration visualization panel and in the data mapper. 

. In the *Data Type Description* field, provide information that helps you
distinguish this type. This description appears in the data mapper when 
you hover over the step that processes this type. 
. Click *Done*. 

The connection appears in the integration flow 
in the location where you added it.
