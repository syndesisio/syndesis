= Adding a Twitter connection to trigger integration execution

In an integration, a connection to Twitter can retrieve the direct
messages of the last 30 days, send a direct message, trigger execution of
an integration when a tweet contains your Twitter handle or when
a tweet contains text that you have specified. A connection to
Twitter must be the integration's start connection.

.Prerequisites
* You created a Twitter connection.
* You must be creating or editing an integration and {prodname} is
prompting you to choose the start connection.

.Procedure

. Click the Twitter
connection that you want to add to the integration. When the integration
uses the selected connection to connect to Twitter, {prodname} uses the
credentials defined in that connection.

. Click the action that you want the selected connection to perform.
A Twitter connection that you add to an integration performs only
the action you choose.
