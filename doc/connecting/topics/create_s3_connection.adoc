= Create Amazon S3 connections

You must create an Amazon S3 connection before you can add an
Amazon S3 connection to an integration.

.Prerequisite
See link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#prerequisites-for-creating-s3-connection_s3[Prerequisites for creating Amazon S3 connections].

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to
display any available connections.
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connectors.
. Click the *Amazon S3* connector.
. In the *Access Key* field, enter the Amazon S3 access key ID,
provided by AWS, for the
AWS account that created the bucket that you want
this connection to access. If the bucket you want the connection to
access does not already exist then when {prodname} tries to start running the 
integration, it uses the AWS account associated with this access key to 
create the bucket. However, if the bucket already exists in some other 
AWS account, then the connection cannot create the bucket and the integration cannot start. 
. In the *Bucket Name or Amazon Resource Name* field, enter the name of
the bucket that you want this connection to access or enter the bucket's ARN.
If the bucket does not already exist 
in either the AWS account being used or in any other AWS account, 
then the connection creates it. 
. In the *Region* field, select the AWS region in which the bucket resides.
If the connection creates the bucket, then it creates it in the
selected region.
. In the *Secret Key* field, enter the Amazon S3 secret access key,
provided by AWS, for the account that created, or will create, 
the bucket that you want this connection to access.
. Click *Validate*. {prodname} immediately tries to validate the
connection and displays a message that indicates whether or not
validation is successful. If validation fails, revise the configuration
details as needed and try again.
. When validation is successful, click *Next*.
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections.
For example, enter `Obtain S3 Data`.
. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. For example,
enter `*Sample S3 connection
that obtains data from the northeast bucket.*`
. In the upper right, click *Create* to see that the connection you
created is now available. If you entered the example name, you would
see that *Obtain S3 Data* appears as a connection that you can 
choose to add to an integration.
