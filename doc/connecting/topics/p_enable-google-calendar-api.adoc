= Enable access to the Google Calendar API

To be able to connect to Google Calendar in an integration, 
you must register your {prodname} environment as a Google client application. 
During registration, you enable the Google Calendar API and create credentials that
{prodname} uses to access Google APIs that you have enabled.  

If you already created a connection to Gmail, then 
{prodname} has the credentials for access to enabled Google
APIs. To be able to create a Google Calendar connection, you just need to
enable the Google Calendar API and then copy {prodname} settings from Gmail 
to Google Calendar.

If you already registered your {prodname} environment as a Google client 
application and during registration you enabled the Google Calendar API, then you do
not need to follow the procedure provided here. You are ready to
create a Google Calendar connection. 

.Prerequisite
In the *Settings* page in your {prodname} environment, the Gmail
entry displays *Edit* and *Remove*, which
indicate that {prodname} has the credentials to access 
enabled Google APIs. If *Register* appears in the Gmail
entry, then you must
