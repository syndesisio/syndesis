= Register {prodname} as a Dropbox client

You must register your {prodname} environment as a client application
that can access Dropbox.
This lets you create any number of integrations that connect
to Dropbox. In other words, you need to register a particular
{prodname} environment with Dropbox only once.

In each {prodname} environment, there can be only one registration
of {prodname} as a Dropbox client application. However, while each Dropbox 
connection uses the same registration, it can use different user
credentials. 

.Prerequisite
You can sign in to the Dropbox account that you want an integration to use
to download or upload files. 

.Procedure

. In {prodname}:
.. In the left panel, click *Settings*.
.. On the *Settings* page, near the top, to the right of the callback URL, 
click 
image:shared/images/CopyCallback.png[Copy Callback URL] to 
copy the callback URL for your {prodname} environment to the clipboard. 
You will need this URL toward the end of this procedure. 
. In another browser tab, go  to `https://www.dropbox.com` 
and do the following:
.. Sign in to the Dropbox account that has the data that you want to
access in an integration. 
.. After signing in, go to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps.
.. Click *Create App*.
.. Select *Dropbox API*. 
.. Near the top of the page, in the sentence that starts with
`*During registration, enter this callback URL:*`,
paste the URL that you copied to the clipboard at the beginning of this procedure. 
For example, the URL that you paste is something like this:
`\https://app-proj9128.7b63.{prodnameinurl}.openshiftapps.com/api/v1/credentials/callback`.
.. Choose whether {prodname} can access a single folder or all of the 
folders and files. 
.. Specify a name for your Dropbox app. For example, you might
specify `*Fuse Online Access From Aslan LLC*`. The name you specify must be
unique in the set of Dropbox app names. 
.. Check the box to indicate that you agree to Dropbox API terms and 
conditions. 
.. Click *Create App*. 

.. In the Dropbox *Settings* page for your new app, in
the input field for *OAuth2 Redirect URIs*, paste your {prodname} URL,
which you copied to the clipboard at the beginning of this procedure. 
.. Click *Add*. 

.Result 

Your {prodname} environment is now registered as a Dropbox client, which 
means that {prodname} can access content in the Dropbox account that
you signed into.
