[[address-model-for-enmasse]]
= Address model for EnMasse

This document defines the EnMasse address model. This involves the types of
address spaces, the types of addresses within each address space, and the
available plans.

[[definitions]]
== Definitions

[[address-space]]
=== Address space

An Address Space is a group of addresses that can be accessed through a single
connection (per protocol). This means that clients connected to the endpoints of
an address space may send or receive messages to any address it is _authorized_
to send or receive messages to within that address space. An address space may
support multiple protocols, which is defined by the address space type.

TODO: How should multiple protocols be handled? How does it relate to plans?

[[address]]
=== Address

An Address is part of an Address Space, and represents a destination used for
sending and receiving messages. An address has a type, which defines the
semantics of sending and receiving messages to/from that address. Each address
may also support a set of properties that may change the semantics and/or
control who may interact with that address.

TODO: Perhaps a more precise definition?

[[plans]]
=== Plans

Both Address Spaces and Addresses may be restricted by a plan, which translates
to a limit on resource usage across multiple dimensions. The set of plans may be
extended in the future, and the constraints imposed by a plan within an address
space may change as operational experience is gained.

[[address-space-plans]]
==== Address Space Plans

Each Address Space has plan that restricts the aggregated resource usage within
an address space. Each address space type may translate the plan into a set of
restrictions such as 'may scale up to 5 routers' or 'may create up to 10
addresses'. These restrictions are documented within each address space.

[[address-plans]]
==== Address Plans

The usage of each address is also constrained by a plan. Each address type maybe
translate the plan into a set of restrictions such as 'up to 5 consumers' or 'up
to 100 messages/hour'. The restrictions of a plan is documented within each
address type.

[[address-spaces]]
== Address spaces

The currently supported address spaces are:

* standard

[[standard-address-space]]
=== Standard address space

The `standard` address space is the default in EnMasse, and consists of an AMQP
router network in combination with attachable 'storage units'. The
implementation of a storage unit is hidden from the client and the routers with
a well defined API. This address space type is appropriate when you have many
connections and addresses, but requires message ordering to be enforced by
clients.

Clients connect and send/receive messages in this address space using the
http://www.amqp.org[AMQP] or http://www.mqtt.org[MQTT] protocols. See
link:../mqtt-over-amqp[MQTT over AMQP] for how MQTT and AMQP addresses co-exists
in this address space.

TODO: This reflects the status quo, but how should multiple protocols actually
be surfaced?

[[address-types]]
==== Address types

The standard address space supports 4 address types:

* queue
* topic
* anycast
* broadcast

TODO: Document plan restrictions

[[queue]]
===== Queue
// address.queue.label:A store-and-forward queue
// address.queue.tooltip:start
The `queue` address type is a store-and-forward queue. This address type is
appropriate for implementing a distributed work queue, handling traffic bursts
and other usecases where you want to decouple the producer and consumer. A queue
may be sharded across multiple storage units, in which case message order is no
longer guaranted.
// address.queue.tooltip:end

[[queue-plans]]
===== Queue Plans

* inmemory
* persisted
* pooled-inmemory
* pooled-persisted

[[in-memory]]
===== In memory
// address.queue.plan.inmemory.label:In memory only
// address.queue.plan.inmemory.tooltip:start
Creates a standalone broker cluster for queues. Messages are not persisted on
stable storage.
// address.queue.plan.inmemory.tooltip:stop

[[persisted]]
===== Persisted

// address.queue.plan.persisted.label:Saved to storage
// address.queue.plan.persisted.tooltip:start
Creates a standalone broker cluster for queues. Messages are persisted on stable
storage.
// address.queue.plan.persisted.tooltip:stop

[[pooled-in-memory]]
===== Pooled in memory
// address.queue.plan.pooled-inmemory.label:Shared broker cluster - not persisted
// address.queue.plan.pooled-inmemory.tooltip:start
Schedules queues to run on a shared broker cluster, reducing overhead. Messages
are not persisted on stable storage.
// address.queue.plan.pooled-inmemory.tooltip:stop

[[pooled-persisted]]
===== Pooled persisted

// address.queue.plan.pooled-persisted.label:Shared broker cluster - saved to storage
// address.queue.plan.pooled-persisted.tooltip:start
Schedules queues to run on a shared broker cluster, reducing overhead. Messages
are persisted on stable storage.
// address.queue.plan.pooled-persisted.tooltip:stop

TODO: Document plan restrictions TODO: Document properties

[[topic]]
===== Topic

// address.topic.label:A publish-subscriber topic
// address.topic.tooltip:start
The `topic` address type supports the publish-subscribe messaging pattern where
you have 1..N producers and 1..M consumers. Each message published to a topic
address is forwarded to all subscribers for that address. A subscriber may also
be durable, in which case messages are kept until the subscriber has
acknowledged them.
// address.topic.tooltip:stop

[[topic-plans]]
===== Topic Plans

* inmemory
* persisted

[[in-memory-1]]
===== In memory

// address.topic.plan.inmemory.label:In memory only
// address.topic.plan.inmemory.tooltip:start
Creates a standalone broker cluster for topics. Messages are not persisted on
stable storage.
// address.topic.plan.inmemory.tooltip:stop

[[persisted-1]]
===== Persisted

// address.topic.plan.persisted.label:Saved to storage
// address.topic.plan.persisted.tooltip:start
Creates a standalone broker cluster for topics. Messages are persisted on stable
storage.
// address.topic.plan.persisted.tooltip:stop

TODO: Document plan restrictions TODO: Document properties

[[anycast]]
===== Anycast

// address.anycast.label:A scalable 'direct' address for sending messages to one consumer
// address.anycast.tooltip:start
The `anycast` address type is a scalable 'direct' address for sending messages
to one consumer. Messages sent to an `anycast` address is not stored but
forwarded directly to the consumer. This makes this address type ideal for
request-reply (RPC) uses or even work distribution. This is the cheapest address
type as it doesn't require any persistence.
// address.anycast.tooltip:stop

[[anycast-plans]]
===== Anycast Plans

* standard

[[standard]]
===== Standard

// address.anycast.plan.inmemory.label:Configures router network with anycast address

TODO: Document plan restrictions TODO: Document properties

[[multicast]]
===== Multicast

// address.multicast.label:A scalable 'direct' address for sending messages to multiple consumers
// address.multicast.tooltip:start
The `broadcast` address type is a scalable 'direct' address for sending messages
to multiple consumers. Messages sent to a `broadcast` address are forwarded to
all consumers receiving on that address. It is important to note that only
pre-settled messages can be sent to broadcast addresses, as message
acknowledgements from consumers are not propagated to producers.
// address.multicast.tooltip:stop

[[multicast-plans]]
===== Multicast Plans

* standard

[[standard-1]]
===== Standard

// address.multicast.plan.inmemory.label:Configures router network with multicast address
