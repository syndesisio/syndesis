:context: kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that you can use to
obtain and publish data. 
In an integration, you can subscribe for data from a Kafka topic 
that you specify or publish data to a Kafka topic that you specify.  
To do this, create a connection to Kafka and add that connection to an 
integration flow. Details are in the following topics:

* xref:creating-kafka-connections_{context}[]
* xref:adding-kafka-connection-start_{context}[]
