= Connecting to API clients
:context: rest

In an integration, to connect to a REST or a SOAP API, you must have created a
connector for that API. See 
link:{LinkSyndesisIntegrationGuide}#adding-api-connectors_custom[{NameOfSyndesisIntegrationGuide}, Adding and managing API client connectors].

When a connector for the API that you want to connect to
is available in {prodname}, the steps for connecting to that API are:

* xref:register-with-rest-api_{context}[] if required
* xref:create-rest-api-connection_{context}[]
* xref:create-soap-api-connection_{context}[]
* xref:add-api-client-connection_{context}[]
