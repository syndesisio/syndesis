= Connecting to OData
:context: odata

Open Data Protocol (OData) is a standard for building and 
consuming REST APIs. An OData service provides services to 
clients, such as {prodname}, through OData-compliant 
HTTP requests. A {prodname} integration can obtain 
entities from an OData service, and can update, create, or
delete entities managed by an OData service. To do this, create an 
OData connection, and add it to an integration. 

It is assumed that you are familiar with the OData specification 
link:http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part2-url-conventions.html[Version 4] or http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0[Version 2].
 
Details for connecting to an OData service are in the following topics:
