In an integration, you can obtain messages from a
Red Hat AMQ broker or publish messages to 
a Red Hat AMQ broker. Red Hat AMQ uses the OpenWire protocol for communication
between clients and message brokers. To communicate with the following 
broker types, use the Red Hat AMQ connector to create a connection to the
broker of interest:

* Apache ActiveMQ broker that does not support AMQP
* AMQ 6 broker

To communicate with one of the following broker types, 
link:{LinkSyndesisConnectorGuide}#connecting-to-amqp_amqp[use the AMQP connector] 
to create a connection to the broker of interest:

* Apache ActiveMQ broker that supports AMQP
* Apache ActiveMQ Artemis 
* AMQ 7 broker
* EnMasse, which is an open source messaging platform
