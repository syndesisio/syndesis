= Managing integrations
:context: manage

A common set up is to have
a {prodname} development environment, a {prodname} test environment, 
and a {prodname} deployment environment. 
To facilitate this, {prodname} provides the ability to export an 
integration from one {prodname} environment and then import that integration
into another {prodname} environment. 
The information and procedures for managing integrations are the same
in each kind of {prodname} environment, unless specifically noted. 

The following topics provide information to help you manage your
integrations:

* xref:about-integration-lifecycle-handling_{context}[]
* xref:putting-integrations-into-service_{context}[]
* xref:add-log-step_{context}[]
* xref:monitoring-integrations_{context}[]
* xref:testing-integrations_{context}[]
* xref:troubleshooting-integration-execution_{context}[]
* xref:updating-integrations_{context}[]
* xref:adjusting-integration-configuration_{context}[]
* xref:deleting-integrations_{context}[]
* xref:copying-integrations-to-other-environments_{context}[]
