= Mapping integration data to fields for the next connection
:context: map

In most flows, you need to map data fields that have already 
been obtained or processed to data fields that the next connection in the
flow can process.
{prodname} provides a data mapper to help you do this. In a flow,
at each point where you need to map data fields, add a data mapper step.

When you add a data mapper step, Syndesis displays the data mapper canvas with:
* Source data fields that are provided by previous connections
* Target data fields that are required by the subsequent connection

[IMPORTANT]
The data mapper displays the largest possible set of source fields that can 
be provided by the previous integration step. However, not all connections 
provide data in each displayed source field. For example, a change to a 
third-party application might discontinue providing data in a particular field. 
As you create an integration, if you notice that data mapping is not behaving 
as you expect, ensure that the source field that you want to map contains the 
data that you expect.
