= Implementing the AMQ to REST API sample integration

:context: amq2api
This sample integration connects to a Red Hat AMQ broker to obtain item
delivery records for a hypothetical enterprise. The integration then executes
a custom step that operates on the records to identify any
items that were damaged when they were received. After a simple data mapping,
the integration connects to
a REST API to obtain contact information for vendors of
damaged items.

The other sample integrations use connectors and data operations that are built
into {prodname}. This integration also does that, but in addition,
it provides instructions for customizing
and extending {prodname} by leading you through the procedures for:

* Adding a custom data operation by uploading an extension.
* Adding a custom REST API client connector by uploading an OpenAPI document.

{prodname} provides the extension file and the OpenAPI document.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in to {prodname}.
If you are not already logged in, see
link:{LinkSyndesisTutorials}#logging-in-and-out_tutorials[What to expect the first time that you use {prodname}.]

* You are working in a {prodname} evaluation environment that is running
on OpenShift Dedicated or you are working in a {prodname}
environment that is running in an OpenShift Container Platform project in which
an administrator added the {prodname} sample data, which provides the *To Do*
app for confirming that the integration works as expected.
