= Implementing the Twitter to Salesforce sample integration
:context: t2sf

This sample integration watches Twitter for tweets that mention
a particular Twitter user. When the integration finds such tweets,
it filters
them so that only those tweets that contain the text that you specify cause
the integration to continue.

For tweets that contain the specified text, the integration passes
data related to the tweet, including the Twitter user name, to Salesforce
and Salesforce creates a new contact.

.Prerequisites
* You need a Twitter developer account. If you do not already have one, 
go to https://apps.twitter.com, sign in to Twitter, and click 
*Apply for a developer account*. Obtaining the developer account is 
quick when you provide a professional email address, 
such as `me@redhat.com` rather than a personal address such as `you@gmail.com`.	

* You need an account in a Salesforce installation that is used for development.
This account must have Salesforce API access, which is available in a
Salesforce Enterprise account or a Salesforce Developer account. To obtain
a free developer account, visit https://developer.salesforce.com/signup.
It takes less than two minutes to obtain a Salesforce account.

* You must be logged in to your {prodname} environment. 
If you are not already logged in, see
