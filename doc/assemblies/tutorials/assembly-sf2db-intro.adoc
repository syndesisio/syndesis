= Implementing the Salesforce to database sample integration
:context: sf2db

This sample integration captures updates in Salesforce and then
calls a database stored procedure, which synchronizes that database
with the Salesforce updates.

.Prerequisites

* You need an account in a Salesforce installation that is used for development.
This account must have Salesforce API access, which is available in a
Salesforce Enterprise account or a Salesforce Developer account. To obtain
a free developer account, visit https://developer.salesforce.com/signup.
It takes less than two minutes to obtain a Salesforce account.
+
If you already created the Twitter to Salesforce sample integration:

** {prodname} is already registered as a Salesforce client.
You do not need to do this again.
** You already have a Salesforce connection, which you can reuse in
this sample integration.

+
If you did not already create the Twitter to Salesforce sample
integration, then you must register {prodname} as a Salesforce client
and create a Salesforce connection in order to complete the
Salesforce to database sample integration.

* You must be logged in to your {prodname} environment. 
If you are not already logged in, see 
link:{LinkSyndesisTutorials}#logging-in-and-out_tutorials[What to expect the first time that you use {prodname}.]
* You are working in a {prodname} evaluation environment that is running on OpenShift Dedicated or you are working in a {prodname} 
environment that is running in an OpenShift Container Platform project in 
which an administrator added the {prodname} sample data, which provides the 
*PostgresDB* connection and the *To Do* app for confirming that the integration works as expected.
