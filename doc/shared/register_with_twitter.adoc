= Register {prodname} as a Twitter client application

In an integration, to connect to Twitter, the first thing you must do is
register your {prodname} environment as a client application
that can access Twitter.
This lets you create any number of integrations that connect
to Twitter. In other words, you need to register a particular
{prodname} environment with Twitter only once.

In each {prodname} environment, there can be only one registration
of {prodname} as a Twitter client application. However, while each Twitter
connection uses the same registration, it can use different user
credentials. 

.Prerequisite
You are logged in to {prodname}. The URL for accessing {prodname} is in the 
email message that welcomed you to the Red Hat Fuse Online Evaluation program. 

.Procedure

. In {prodname}:
.. In the left panel, click *Settings*.
.. On the *Settings* page, near the top, to the right of the callback URL, click 
image:images/CopyCallback.png[Copy Callback URL] to 
copy the callback URL for your installation of {prodname} to the clipboard. 
You will need this URL later in this procedure. 
.. To the right of the *Twitter* entry,
click *Register* to display the *Consumer Key* and *Consumer Secret* fields.
. In another browser tab, go to your
https://developer.twitter.com/apps[Twitter developer account], sign in if you
need to, and do the following: 

.. In the upper right, next to the name of your developer project, click the 
down caret and click *Apps*. 
.. In the upper right, click *Create an app*. 
.. In the *App name* field, enter a name such as *My {prodname} Client*. 
.. In the *Application description* field, enter a tip such as 
*For leveraging tweets*. 
.. In the *Website URL* field, paste the URL that you copied at the beginning
of this procedure and remove `api/v1/credentials/callback` from the end
of the URL.
.. Select *Enable Sign in with Twitter*. 
.. In the *Callback URLs* field, paste the URL again. It should be
something like this:
`\https://app-proj9128.7b63.{prodnameinurl}.openshiftapps.com/api/v1/credentials/callback`.
.. A 100-character description of how you plan to use this app is required. 
For convenience, you can copy and paste: 
`This is a demo application so that I can evaluate how to integrate Twitter 
with my enterprise applications.`
.. Click *Create*. 
.. Click *Create* again to confirm that you reviewed the developer terms. 
.. At the top of the page for the app you just created, click 
the *Keys and tokens* tab. 
.. Copy the API key. 

. Return to your {prodname} *Settings* page and paste the Twitter
consumer API key into the {prodname} Twitter *Consumer Key* field.
. Return to the Twitter *Keys and tokens* tab and copy the consumer API secret key. 
. Return to your {prodname} *Settings* page and paste the Twitter
consumer API secret key into the {prodname} Twitter
*Consumer Secret* field.
. Click *Save* and then click *Ok*.
