= Register {prodname} as a Twitter client

You must register your installation of {prodname} as an application
that can access Twitter.
This lets you create any number of integrations that connect
to Twitter. In other words, you need to register {prodname}
with Twitter only once.

Perform these steps:

. In {prodname}:
.. In the left panel, click *Home*.
.. Copy the {prodname} URL from the browser address bar so it is in the
clipboard.
.. In the left panel, click *Settings*.
.. In the *OAuth Application Management* page, to the right of *Twitter*,
click *Register* to display the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields.
. In another browser tab, go  to `http://apps.twitter.com` and do
the following:
.. If you are not already logged in to Twitter, log in.
.. Click *Create New App*.
.. In the *Name* field, enter a name for your new app. This name
must be unique among all names of apps registered with Twitter.
.. In the *Description* field, enter helpful information.
Twitter requires some input in this field.
.. Paste your {prodname} URL into the *Website* and
*Callback URL* fields.
.. In the *Callback URL* field, remove `dashboard` from the end
of the URL and append `api/v1/credentials/callback`.
For example:
`\https://app-proj9128.7b63.{prodnameinurl}.openshiftapps.com/api/v1/credentials/callback`.
.. Click *Yes* to agree to the Twitter developer agreement.
.. Click *Create your Twitter application*.
.. Click the *Keys and Access Tokens* tab.
.. Copy the *Consumer Key*.
. On your {prodname} installation *Settings* page, paste the Twitter
consumer key into the Twitter *Client ID* field.
. On the Twitter *Keys and Access Tokens* tab, copy the
*Consumer Secret* and paste it into the {prodname} Twitter
*Client Secret* field.
. Click *Save* and then click *Ok*.
