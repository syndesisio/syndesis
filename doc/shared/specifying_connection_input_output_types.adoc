= Specifying connection input or output types

To process data from the start connection through the finish connection,
sometimes you need to specify input/output types when you configure
a connection's action. Type specifications let {prodname} alert you when a 
data mapping step is required. A data mapping step ensures that the next
integration step can process the data it receives.

After you configure an AMQ, AMQP, or Amazon S3 connection, {prodname}
prompts you to specify input and/or output data types as follows:

. In the *Select Type* field, if the data type does not need to be known, 
accept *Type specification not required* 
and then, at the bottom, click *Done*. You do not need to follow the rest of these
instructions. 
+
Otherwise, select one of the following as the schema type:
+
* *JSON schema*
* *JSON instance* 
* *XML schema*
* *XML instance*

. In the *Definition* input box, paste a definition that conforms to the
schema type you selected. 
For example, if you select *JSON schema* then you would paste the content of
a JSON schema file.

. In the *Data Type Name* field, enter a name that you choose for the
data type. For example, suppose you are specifying a JSON schema for
vendors. You can specify `*Vendor*` as the data type name. 
+
You will see this data type name when you are creating 
or editing an integration that uses the connection
for which you are specifying this type. {prodname} displays the type name
in the integration visualization panel and in the data mapper. 

. In the *Data Type Description* field, provide information that helps you
distinguish this type. This description appears in the data mapper when 
you hover over the step that processes this type. 
. Click *Done*.
