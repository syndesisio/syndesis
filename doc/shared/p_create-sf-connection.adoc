[id='create-salesforce-connection_{context}']
= Create a Salesforce connection

To create an integration that accesses data in Salesforce, you 
must first create a Salesforce connection.  
After you create a Salesforce connection, you can use it in multiple 
integrations.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to {prodname}. The URL for accessing {prodname} is in the 
email message that welcomed you to the Red Hat Fuse Online Evaluation program. 
* {prodname} is open in a web browser. 
* You must have already registered your {prodname} environment as an
application that can access Salesforce. 
+
ifeval::["{context}" == "t2sf"]
If you did not already register {prodname}, see 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineTutorials}#register-with-salesforce_t2sf[Register with Salesforce].
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "sf2db"]
If you did not already register {prodname}, see 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineTutorials}#register-with-salesforce_sf2db[Register with Salesforce].
endif::[]

+
Be sure to wait 2 - 10 minutes after registering your {prodname}
installation as a Salesforce client before you try to create a
Salesforce connection. 

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to display available connections.
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
the available connectors. A connector is a template for creating one
or more connections.
. Click the *Salesforce* connector.
. Click *Connect Salesforce* to display a Salesforce authorization page.
You might need to log in to Salesforce before you see the authorization page.
+
[NOTE]
====
The following error indicates that Salesforce does not have the
correct {prodname} callback URL:

`error=redirect_uri_mismatch&error_description=redirect_uri%20must%20match%20configuration`

If you get this error message, then in Salesforce, ensure that the {prodname}
callback URL is specified according to the instructions in
link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#register-with-salesforce_salesforce[Register with Salesforce].
====
. Click *Allow* to return to {prodname}.
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections.
For example, enter `*SF Connect 1*`.
. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. For example,
enter `*Sample Salesforce connection
that uses my Salesforce login credentials.*`
. In the upper right, click *Create* to see that the connection you
created is now available. If you entered the example name, you would
see that *SF Connect 1* appears as a connection that you can 
choose to add to an integration.
