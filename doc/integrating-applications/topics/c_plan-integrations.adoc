= Considerations for planning your integrations

Consider the following questions before you create an integration.

How do you want to trigger execution of the integration?

* Do you want to set a timer to trigger execution at intervals that you
specify?
* Do you want to send an HTTP request?
* Do you want to connect to an application to obtain data from?
** In that application, what triggers the action that obtains the data?
For example, an integration that starts by obtaining data from
Twitter might trigger on a Twitter mention.
** What are the data fields of interest?
** What credentials does {prodname} use to access this application?
 * Do you want to invoke a REST API client call that triggers 
 execution of a particular REST API operation?

To finish a simple integration:

* Which application receives the data?
* In that application, what action does the integration perform?
* What are the data fields of interest?
* What credentials does {prodname} use to access this application?

In a simple integration's set of steps or in each operation flow's set of steps:

* Do you need to access any other applications? For any other
applications that need to be accessed:
+
** Which application does the flow need to connect to?
** What action should the connection perform?
** What are the data fields of interest?
** What credentials should the connection use to connect to this application?

* Does the flow need to operate on the data between connections?
For example:
+
** Should the flow filter the data it operates on?
** Do field names differ between source and target applications? If they
do then data mapping is required.
** Does the flow need to split a collection into 
individual records or aggregrate multiple records into a collection?
** Would a template be helpful for outputting data in a consistent form?
** Do you want to send information about messages being processed to the
integration's log?
** Does the flow need to operate on the data in some customized way?
