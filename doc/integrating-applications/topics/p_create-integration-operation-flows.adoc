= Create the integration's operation flows

The OpenAPI document that defines your REST API service defines
the operations that the service can perform. After you create an API
provider integration, you can edit the
integration flow for each operation. 

Each operation has exactly one integration flow. 
In an integration flow, you can add connections
to other applications and services, as well as steps that operate on data
between connections. 

.Prerequisites

* You created an API provider integration, gave it a name, and saved it.
* You created a connection to each application or service that you want
an integration flow to connect to. For details, see the
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#about-creating-connections_connections[information about creating connections].
* {prodname} is displaying the *Choose operation* page. 

.Procedure

. In the *Choose operation* page, click the entry for an operation
whose flow you want to edit. This opens the *Add to Integration* page.

. In the integration visualization panel on the left, click the 
image:images/ApiProviderReturnIcon.png[Provided API Return Path] icon
at the bottom. When you hover over this icon, *Provided API Return Path* 
appears.
+
Every API provider integration ends each integration flow by 
sending a response to the REST API caller that triggered execution of the 
integration flow.

. Specify the operation's return code as follows: 
.. In the *Provided API Return Path* page, click in the *Return Code*
input field, which displays a list of possible return codes. 
.. Scroll to *200 OK* and click it. 
+
If there is a return code that better describes the result then you 
can select that one instead. However, in this Technology Preview release,
you can select only one return code. Whenever an API call triggers 
execution of this integration flow, this is the return code. This
Technology Preview release does not support error handling. 

.. Click *Done*.
.. In the upper right, click *Save as Draft*. 
+
After you implement the return code for at least one operation, 
you can publish the integration to start running it. When it is
running, you can invoke an API call that triggers execution of
the integration flow for which you defined the return code. However,
you probably want to add more steps to the operation's flow. 

. In this integration flow, to connect to another application or service: 
.. In the integration flow visualization panel on the left, hover over the
plus sign in the location where you want to add a connection and in the 
popup that appears, click *Add a connection*.
.. Click the connection that you want to add to this integration flow. 
.. Click the action that you want this connection to perform.  
.. Configure the action. 
.. Click *Done*. 
.. In the upper right, click *Save as Draft*. 

+
For each connection that you want to add to this integration flow, repeat
this subset of instructions. Add all desired connections to the integration flow
before you continue. 

. In this integration flow, to process data between connections:
.. In the integration flow visualization panel on the left, hover over the
plus sign in the location where you want to add a step and in the
popup that appears, click *Add a step*. 
.. In the *Choose a Step* page, click the step that you want to add. 
.. Configure the step. 
.. Click *Done*. 
.. In the upper right, click *Save as Draft*. 

+
For help, see
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#about-adding-steps_create[Adding steps between connections].

+
Repeat this subset of instructions to add another step that processes
data between connections.

. In the integration flow visualization panel on the left, check for 
data type mismatch 
image:images/DataTypeMismatchWarning.png[data mismatch] icons, which
indicate that the connection cannot process the incoming data. You need
to add a data mapper step here. Go back to the previous 
subset of instructions. 
On the *Choose a Step* page, click *Data Mapper*, and define the
needed mappings. For help, see
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#mapping-data_ug[Map integration data fields to the next connection in the integration].

. When this integration flow has all needed 
connections and steps, do one of the following:
* To start running the integration, in the upper right, click *Publish*.
This builds the integration and makes it available to be executed. 
You can publish the integration each time that you
complete the creation of an operation's integration flow or each
time that you edit an operation's integration flow.
* To edit the integration flow for another operation, 
in the upper right, click 
*Go to Operations List*. 

Repeat this procedure to edit another operation's 
integration flow.

[NOTE]
==== 
In this release, in an integration flow, a connection to a SQL database 
that executes a `SELECT` statement returns only the first record 
in the result set.

In this Technology Preview release, in an integration flow, 
a connection to a SQL database 
that executes a `SELECT` statement returns only the first record in

.Next steps
When an API provider integration 
is running, you can use the `curl` utility to confirm that it is
working as expected. For examples of doing this, see 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#try-api-provider-quickstart_api-provider[the description of the API provider quickstart].
