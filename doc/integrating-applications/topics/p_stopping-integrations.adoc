running an integration.

.Procedure

. In the left {prodname} panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the list of integrations, identify the entry for the integration that you
want to stop running. The entry shows that this integration is *Running*.
. At the far right of this integration's entry, click

and select *Stop*.

.Result

*Stopped* appears in the
integration's entry in the list of integrations.
