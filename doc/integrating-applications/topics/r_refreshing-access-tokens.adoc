= Automatically refresh access tokens

If an access token has an expiration date, then {prodname} integrations 
that use that token to connect to an application stop running successfully 
when the taken expires. To obtain a new access token, you must 
either reconnect to the application or re-register with the application. 

If you need to, you can change this default behavior so that
{prodname} automatically requests a new access token in the 
following situations:

* When the expiration date has been reached.
* When HTTP response status codes that you specify are received.

To specify that {prodname} should automatically try to obtain a new 
access token in the situations described, 
in the `securityDefinitions` section of the OpenAPI document, 
add the `x-refresh-token-retry-statuses` vendor extension. The setting 
of this extension is a comma separated list that
specifies HTTP response status codes. When an access token's 
expiration date is reached or when {prodname} receives a message
from an OAuth2 provider and the message has one of these response status
codes, then {prodname} automatically tries to obtain a new access token. 
In the example
below, the last line specifies `x-refresh-token-retry-statuses`:

    scopes:
      LIST: Access List API
    x-refresh-token-retry-statuses: 401,402,403

[NOTE]
====
Sometimes, an API operation fails and a side effect of that
failure is that the access token is refreshed. In this situation, 
even when obtaining a new access token is successful, the
API operation still fails. In other words, {prodname} does
not retry the failed API operation after it receives the new
access token.
