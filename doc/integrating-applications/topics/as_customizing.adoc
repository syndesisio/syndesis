= Customize {prodname}
:context: custom

{prodname} provides many connectors that you can use to connect to 
common applications and services. There are also a number of built-in
steps for processing data in common ways. However, if {prodname} does
not provide a feature that you need, talk with a developer about 
your requirements. An experienced developer can help you customize
integrations by providing any of the following:

* An OpenAPI document that {prodname} can
use to create a connector for a REST API client. 
+
You upload this schema to
{prodname} and {prodname} creates a connector according to the schema. 
You then use the connector to create a connection that you
can add to an integration. For example, many retail web sites provide
a REST API client interface that a developer can capture in an 
OpenAPI document.  

* An OpenAPI document that defines a REST API service. 
+
You upload this schema to {prodname}. {prodname} makes the
API service available and provides the URL for API calls. This lets you 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#trigger-integrations-with-api-calls_ug[trigger integration execution with an API call]. 

* A `JAR` file that implements a {prodname} extension. An extension
can be any one of the following:  
+
** One or more steps that operate on integration data between connections
** A connector for an application or service
** A library resource such as a JDBC driver for a proprietary SQL database
+
You upload this `JAR` file to {prodname} and {prodname} makes the 
custom feature provided by the extension available.
