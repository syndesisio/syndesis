= Configure and publish the API provider quickstart integration

{prodname} provides an API provider quickstart integration that you can 
import into your {prodname} environment. This quickstart includes 
an OpenAPI schema for a task management API. After importing
the quickstart integration, you configure return codes, and then publish
the integration. After you complete the procedure described below,
the Task API integration is running and ready
to be executed. 

The API provider quickstart helps you quickly learn how to configure, publish, and
test an API provider integration. But it is not a real-world example of 
how useful an API provider integration can be. For a real-world
example, suppose that you already
used {prodname} to publish several integrations. You could define an OpenAPI
schema for triggering execution of those integrations. To do this, you
would edit the integration flow for each OpenAPI operation to be almost the
same as the integrations you already published.

.Prerequisites

{prodname} is open in a browser.

.Procedure

. To import the Task API quickstart integration:
.. Go to 
https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-quickstarts/tree/master/api-provider 
and download `TaskAPI-export.zip`. 
.. In {prodname}, in the left navigation panel, click *Integrations*. 
.. In the upper right, click *Import*. 
.. Drag and drop the zip file that you downloaded. {prodname} indicates
that it has successfully imported the file. 
.. In the left navigation panel, click *Integrations* to see
an entry for the *Task API* integration that you just imported. The entry
indicates that configuration is required. 

. To configure the Task API integration:
.. Click the *Task API* entry to display the integration summary. 
.. In the upper right, click *Edit Integration* to display a list
of the operations that this API provides. 
.. To configure the integration flow for the *Create Task* operation: 
... Click the *Create Task* entry to display a page that prompts you to
add a connection or add a step. 
+
Connections and steps have already been
added to this integration flow. In the integration flow visualization panel
on the left, move your cursor over the icons to see what they represent. Click a 
step or connection to view its configuration. When you are done
examining one, click another one to examine it. When you click 
a database connection, you can see the SQL statement that it executes. 
... In the integration flow visualization panel on the left, click the 
image:images/ApiProviderReturnIcon.png[Provided API Return Path] icon
at the bottom. You might have to scroll down to see it. When you hover 
over it, {prodname} displays *Provided API Return Path*. 
... Click in the *Return Code* input field and scroll to select 
*201 Created*. 
... Click *Done*.
... In the upper right, click *Save as Draft* and then *Go to Operation List*.
.. To configure the integration flow for the *Delete Task for ID* operation:
... Click the *Delete Task for ID* entry to display a page that prompts you to
add a connection or add a step. 
+
This integration flow has a data mapper step and a connection to the
sample database that is provided with {prodname}. 
In the integration flow visualization panel, 
click the database connection to view the SQL statement that it executes. 
... In the integration flow visualization panel, click the 
image:images/ApiProviderReturnIcon.png[Provided API Return Path] icon
at the bottom. 
... Click in the *Return Code* input field and scroll to select 
*200 OK*. 
... Click *Done*.
... In the upper right, click *Save as Draft* and then *Go to Operation List*.
.. To configure the integration flow for the *Get Task by ID* operation:
... Click the *Get Task by ID* entry to display a page that prompts you to
add a connection or add a step. 
+
This integration flow has two data mapper steps, a connection to the
sample database that is provided with {prodname}, and a log step. 
In the integration flow visualization panel, click an icon for a step
or connection to view its configuration. When you are done examining one,
click another one. 
... In the integration flow visualization panel, click the 
image:images/ApiProviderReturnIcon.png[Provided API Return Path] icon
at the bottom. 
... Click in the *Return Code* input field and scroll to select 
*200 OK*. 
... Click *Done*.

. In the upper right, click *Publish*.
+
{prodname} displays the integration summary page and shows 
publication progress as it assemblies, builds, deploys, and 
starts the integration. The integration summary page also provides 
the external URL for the
API provider service, which looks something like this: 
+
`\https://i-task-api-proj319352.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/api/`
+
This is where {prodname} makes the Task API service available. REST 
API calls specify URLs that start with this base URL.
