= Create an integration that is triggered by an API call

To be able to invoke a call that triggers execution of an integration, you provide
an OpenAPI schema that defines the operations that the integration
can perform. For each operation, you specify an integration flow that
connects to the applications and processes the integration data according to the
requirements for that operation. 

.Prerequisites
* You can provide an OpenAPI schema for the REST API
operations that you want the integration to perform. 
+
To experiment,
https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-quickstarts/blob/master/api-provider/task-api.json[download the `task-api.json` file], 
which is an OpenAPI schema for an API provider quickstart. You can
then drag this file in when {prodname} prompts you to provide an OpenAPI
schema. 
* You have a plan for the integration flow for each OpenAPI operation. 
* You created a connection for each application or service that you want
to add to an integration flow. 

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left navigation panel, click *Integrations*. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Integration*. 
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click the *API Provider* card. 
. On the *Start integration with an API call* page, if you have an OpenAPI 2.0
schema that defines the REST API operations then upload it in one of the 
following ways:
+
* Drag and drop the file that contains the schema. 
* Click *Choose File* to navigate to and select the file that contains the
schema. 
* Click *Use a URL* and enter the URL for the schema. 

+
Or, if you need to define the schema, select *Create from scratch*. 

. Click *Next*. 
+
* If you uploaded a schema, remember that this is your only opportunity
to change it. To review or edit the schema: 
+
.. Click *Review/Edit* to open the Apicurio editor.
.. Review and edit as needed.
.. In the upper right, click *Save* or *Cancel* to close the editor.
.. Click *Next* and go to step 6 in this procedure. 

* If you are creating a schema from scratch then in the Apicurio editor 
that Syndesis opens:
+
.. Define the OpenAPI schema.
.. In the upper right, click *Save*, which closes the editor. 
.. Click *Next*. 

+
For information about using the Apicurio editor, see 
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/{productpkg}/{version}/html-single/designing_apis_with_apicurito/#create-api-definition[Design and develop an API definition with Apicurito].
In this Technology Preview release, you cannot edit the operation 
description that will appear in the operations list in {prodname}. 


. On the *Give this integration a name* page, enter a name for your integration.
. Optionally, enter a description that helps you distinguish this integration
from other integrations. 
. Click *Save and continue* to display the *Choose Operation* page. You are
