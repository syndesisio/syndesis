= Creating an integration that is triggered by an API call

To be able to invoke a call that triggers execution of an integration, you provide
an OpenAPI document that defines the operations that the integration
can perform. For each operation, you specify an execution flow that
connects to applications and processes integration data according to the
requirements for that operation. 

.Prerequisites
* You can provide or define an OpenAPI document for the REST API
operations that you want the integration to perform. 
+
To experiment,
https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-quickstarts/blob/master/api-provider/task-api.json[download the `task-api.json` file], 
which is an OpenAPI document for an API provider quickstart. You can
then drag this file in when {prodname} prompts you to provide an OpenAPI
document. 
* You have a plan for the flow for each OpenAPI operation. 
* You created a connection for each application or service that you want
to add to an operation's flow. 

.Procedure

. In {prodname}, in the left navigation panel, click *Integrations*. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Integration*. 
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click the *API Provider* card. 
. On the *Start integration with an API call* page, if you have an OpenAPI 2.0
document that defines the REST API operations then upload it in one of the 
following ways. You can edit this schema as needed while you are 
creating the API provider integration.
+
* Drag and drop the document that contains the schema. 
* Click *Choose File* to navigate to and select the file that contains the
document. 
* Click *Use a URL* and enter the URL for a document. 

+
Or, if you need to define the OpenAPI 2.0 document, select *Create from scratch*. 

. Click *Next*. 
+
* If you uploaded a document, you can review or edit the document: 
+
.. Click *Review/Edit* to open the Apicurito editor.
.. Review and edit as needed.
.. In the upper right, click *Save* or *Cancel* to close the editor.
.. Click *Next* and go to step 6 in this procedure. 

* If you are creating a document then in the Apicurito editor 
that {prodname} opens:
+
.. Define the OpenAPI document.
.. In the upper right, click *Save*, which closes the editor. 
.. Click *Next*. 

+

. On the *Give this integration a name* page, enter a name for your integration.
. Optionally, enter a description that helps you distinguish this integration
from other integrations. 
. Click *Save and continue* to display the *Operations* page. You are
