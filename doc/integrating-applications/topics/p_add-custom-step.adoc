= Add a custom step

If {prodname} does not provide a step that you need in an integration,
a developer can define one or more custom steps in an extension. A custom
step operates on integration data between connections. 

You add a custom step to an integration in the same way that you add
a built-in step. Create an integration, choose the start and finish
connections, add other connections as needed and then add additional steps.
When you add a step, {prodname} operates on the data it receives from the
previous step(s).

.Prerequisites
* You uploaded the custom step extension to {prodname}. See 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#making-extensions-available_custom[Make extensions available].
* You are creating or editing an integration.
* The integration already has all the connections that it requires.

.Procedure

. In the left panel, where you want to add a custom step to
the integration, hover over the
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign']
and in the popup that appears, click *Add a Step*.

. On the *Add a Step* page, click the custom step that you want to add.
+
The list of available steps includes any
custom steps that are defined in extensions that were uploaded to
your {prodname} environment.

At the top of the list of steps, in the *Name* field, you can select
*Custom Steps* to display only custom steps.

. Respond to prompts for any information that is required to perform the step.
This information varies for each custom step.
