= Confirm that the Salesforce to database integration works

To confirm that the Salesforce to database integration is working:

. In the left pane, click *Integrations*.
. If necessary, wait until your sample integration is an *Active* integration,
which means that it is running. If you used the example name, you would 
see that 
*Salesforce to Database Sample Integration* is *Active*.
. In your Salesforce installation, create a new lead. Be
sure to enter data 
in the fields that you mapped: *Company*, *Email*, *FirstName*,
*LastName*, *LeadSource*, *Status*, *Phone*, and *Rating*. 
. In a new browser window, insert `*todo-*` in front of the URL
for your {prodname} installation. For example: 
`\https://todo-app-proj7614.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/`.
. In the *To Do App* display, you should see a notification that a new 
lead was created in the database.
