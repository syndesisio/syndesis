= Confirm that the AMQ to REST API integration works

To confirm that the AMQ to REST API integration is working:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. If necessary, wait until your sample integration is the *Active* integration,
which means that it is running. If you used the example name, you would 
see that 
*AMQ to REST API Sample Integration* is *Active*.

. In a new browser window, go to the To Do app display by 
inserting `*todo-*` in front of the URL
for your {prodname} installation. For example: 
`\https://todo-proj7614.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/`.
. In the To Do app display, click *Show JMS Form* to display an
input box that contains an XML message. 
. Click *Send JMS Message* to send that message
to the AMQ broker in your OpenShift project. 
+
Successful execution returns a task from the To Do app client API. The task 
identifies the ID of the damaged item and the contact information for its
vendor. 
. Edit the XML message to specify two damaged items:
.. Click *Show JMS Form* to display the message input box again. 
.. In the XML message, change the entry for the undamaged item to 
specify `damaged="true"`.
.. Click *Send JMS Message*. The To Do app client API returns a new
task that contains IDs for two damaged items and contact information for 
the two vendors. 
. Edit the XML message to specify an unknown vendor:
.. Click *Show JMS Form*. 
.. In the XML message, for an item that has `damaged="true"`, change the name 
of the vendor.
.. Click *Send JMS Message*. The To Do app client API returns a new
task that indicates that there is no contact information for the vendor of
a damaged item. The To Do app accesses a database that has only two vendors.
