= Upload the To Do app icon

To show the flow of an integration, {prodname} displays icons that identify 
the applications that the integration is connecting to. Your {prodname} 
installation provides an icon for the REST API connector that you just 
created for the To Do app.

To upload the To Do app icon:

. Display the To Do app icon:

.. In a new browser tab, paste the URL for your Swagger specification.
.. At the end of the URL, replace `swagger.json` with `images/todo_icon.png` 
and click *Enter*. For example: 
`\https://todo-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/images/todo_icon.png`.

. Save the `todo_icon.png` image. 

. In {prodname}, in the *API Client Connectors* tab, click the entry for 
the *Todo App API* to display its details. 

. On the *Connector Details* page, click *Browse*. 

. Navigate to `todo_icon.png`, select it, and click *Open*.
 
. Refresh the display of the *Connector Details* page. 
The image now appears on the left.
