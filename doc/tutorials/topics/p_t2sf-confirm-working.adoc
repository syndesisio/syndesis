= Confirming that the Twitter to Salesforce integration works

To confirm that the Twitter to Salesforce sample integration is working,
create some tweets and check for results in Salesforce. 

.Prerequisites

* In {prodname}, *Running* appears next to the name that you specified
for the Twitter to Salesforce sample integration when you published it.
* You can access your Twitter and Salesforce accounts. 

.Procedure
. In {prodname} in the panel on the left, click *Integrations* to see that the integration you
created is a *Running* integration. If you entered the example name, you
would see that *Twitter to Salesforce Sample Integration* is running.

. Confirm that the integration does not create a contact record when a
tweet does not contain the text you specified in the basic filter
step:
.. In Twitter, send a tweet that:
* Mentions your Twitter handle
* Does not contain the text that you specified in the basic filter step
+
For example: `*@Aslan #likesRedHat.*`
.. Wait for the polling interval to elapse, which can be 30 - 60 seconds.
.. In Salesforce, confirm that there is *not* a new contact record for the 
name that is associated with the Twitter account that you used to tweet.

. Confirm that the integration creates a new contact record when it should:
.. In Twitter, send a tweet that:
* Mentions your Twitter handle
* Contains the text that you specified in the basic filter step
+
For example: `*@Aslan knows #RedHatIsGreat.*`
.. Wait for the polling interval to elapse.

.. In Salesforce, do the following:
... Log in to your regular Salesforce account, not your Salesforce developer 
account. 
... On your home page, under *Recent Items* you should see your new contact. 
... Click on it to view the details.
+
The new contact record should have the name that is associated with the 
Twitter account that you used to tweet. The text of your tweet should be in the
*Description* field, and your Twitter screen name should be in the *Title* field.

. Optionally, view the integration log to troubleshoot an
unexpected result or to learn more about integration execution: 

.. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Integrations*.
.. View your Twitter to Salesforce integration.
.. In the integration's summary page, click the *Activity* tab.
.. Click the integration execution for which you want to view activity information.
