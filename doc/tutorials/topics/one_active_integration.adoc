{prodname} displays the integration summary page with a *Publishing* spinning
circle. {prodname} is generating the runtime for the integration and
will start it when the runtime is ready. This takes a few minutes. 

In this technology preview, only one integration at a time can be running. 
If you already created one of the other sample integrations and that 
integration is running then this integration is automatically in the
*Unpublished* state. You must stop the running integration by 
unpublishing it before {prodname} can start (publish) this integration. 

To stop an integration:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*. 
. In the entry for the integration that you want to stop, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right. 
. In the popup, click *Unpublish*. 

After stopping (unpublishing) an integration, start another integration as follows:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*. 
. In the entry for the integration that you want to start, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[title="the three vertical dots"]
on the far right. 
. In the popup, click *Publish*.
