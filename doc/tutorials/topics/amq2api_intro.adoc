= Implement an AMQ to REST API sample integration

:context: amq2api
This sample integration connects to an AMQ broker to obtain item
delivery records for a hypothetical enterprise. The integration then executes 
a custom step that operates on the records to identify any
items that were damaged when they were received. After a simple data mapping, 
the integration connects to 
a REST API to obtain and provide contact information for vendors of 
damaged items. 

The other sample integrations use connectors and data operations that are built
into {prodname}. This integration also does that, but in addition, 
it provides instructions for customizing
and extending {prodname} by leading you through the procedures for:

* Adding a custom data operation by uploading an extension.
* Adding a custom REST API client connector by uploading a Swagger file.

{prodname} provides the extension file and the Swagger file. 

To implement the AMQ to REST API sample integration, the main steps are:

. <<amq2api-create-amq-connection>>
. <<amq2api-create-custom-step>>
. <<amq2api-create-rest-api-connector>>
. <<amq2api-upload-todo-app-icon>>
. <<amq2api-create-rest-api-connection>>
. <<amq2api-create-integration>>
. <<amq2api-confirm-works>>
. <<cleanup_{context}>>
