= Confirm that the Twitter to Salesforce integration works 

To confirm that the Twitter to Salesforce sample integration is working:

. In the panel on the left, click *Integrations* to see that the integration you
created is a *Published* integration,
which means that it is running. If you entered the example name, you
would see that *Twitter to Salesforce Sample Integration* is running. 
. Confirm that the integration does not create a contact record when a
tweet does not contain the text you specified in the basic filter 
step:
.. In Twitter, send a tweet that: 
* Mentions your Twitter handle
* Does not contain the text you specified in the basic filter step
+
For example: `*@Aslan #likesRedHat.*`
.. Wait for the polling interval to elapse, which can be 30 - 60 seconds. 
.. In Salesforce, confirm that a contact record with your 
name does not exist. 
. Confirm that the integration creates a new contact record when it should:
.. In Twitter, send a tweet that:
* Mentions your Twitter handle
* Contains the text you specified in the basic filter step
+
For example: `*@Aslan knows #RedHatIsGreat.*`
.. Wait for the polling interval to elapse. 
.. In Salesforce, locate a contact record that has 
your name, the text of your tweet in the
`Description` field, and your Twitter screen name
in the `Title` field.

In this Technology Preview release, exactly one integration at a time can be 
running (published). If you create another integration, it is automatically 
in the *Unpublished* state.
