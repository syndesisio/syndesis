= Create a REST API connector

{prodname} can create connectors for REST APIs
that support Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/1.0 or HTTP/1.1. 
To do this, {prodname} requires a valid
Swagger 2.0 specification that describes a REST API you want to connect to.

Your {prodname} installation provides the To Do app, which has a REST API for
which a Swagger specification is available.
 
To create a REST API connector for the To Do app:

. Identify the URL for your {prodname} installation's copy of the 
Swagger specification:
.. In the {prodname} navigation panel, click *Home*.
.. Copy the URL into a text editor.
.. At the beginning of the URL, insert `*todo-*`.
.. At the end of the URL, replace `dashboard` with `*swagger.json*`.

+
The result is something like this:
`\https://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/swagger.json`

. In the {prodname} navigation panel, click *Customizations*.
. Click *Create API Connector*. 
. Select *Use a URL*. 
. In the input box, paste the URL for your Swagger specification and
click *Next*.
. On the *Review Swagger Actions* page, click *Next*. If you see 
a warning, you can ignore it. 
. Click *Next* again to accept *HTTP Basic Authorization*.
. On the *General Connector Info* page, in the *Host* field, paste the
URL for your Swagger specification and then delete `/swagger.json` from
the end. For example:
`\https://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com`.
. Accept the default values in the other fields and click *Create Connector*.

{prodname} displays the *API Client Connectors* tab with an entry for 
the *Todo App API* that you just created.
