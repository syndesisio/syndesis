= Create a REST API connector

{prodname} can create connectors for REST APIs
that support Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.
To do this, {prodname} requires a valid
OpenAPI 2.0 specification that describes a REST API you want to connect to.

Your {prodname} environment provides the To Do app, which has a REST API
for accessing a database that contains tasks. Your environment also provides
an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for this API.

.Procedure

. Identify the URL for your {prodname} environment's copy of the
OpenAPI specification:
.. In the {prodname} navigation panel, click *Home*.
.. Copy the URL into a text editor.
.. At the beginning of the URL, insert `*todo-*`.
.. At the end of the URL, replace `dashboard` with `*swagger.json*`.
.. Use the `http` scheme instead of `https`.

+
The result is something like this:
`\http://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com/swagger.json`

. In the {prodname} navigation panel, click *Customizations*.
. Click *Create API Connector*.
. Select *Use a URL*.
. In the input box, paste the URL for your OpenAPI specification and
click *Next*.
. On the *Review OpenAPI Actions* page, click *Next*. If you see
a warning, you can ignore it.
. Click *Next* again to accept *HTTP Basic Authorization*.
. On the *Review/Edit Connector Details* page, {prodname} populates
the fields with values from the OpenAPI specification.
.. If you want to, you can
change the values in the *Connector Name* and *Description* fields.
.. Confirm that the value in the *Host* field is correct. For example,
it should be something like this:
`\http://todo-app-proj217402.6a63.fuse-ignite.openshiftapps.com`.
.. Confirm that the value in the *Base URL* field is `/api`.
. Click *Create API Connector*.
+
{prodname} displays the *API Client Connectors* tab with an entry for
the *Todo App API* that you just created.
