= Clean up your integration

In this Technology Preview release, exactly one integration at
a time can be running. You can create another sample integration,
but you cannot publish it while an integration is running.

When you are done working with a sample integration, deactivate it:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the main panel, click the entry for the sample integration
you want to deactivate.
. In the integration summary, click *Stop Integration* and click
*OK* to confirm that you want to stop running the integration.

When there is a deactivated sample integration,
you can run another sample integration.

When you are no longer working with a sample integration you
should delete it. Ensure that the sample integration is
`Inactive` and then at the bottom of the summary, click
*Delete Integration* and *OK* to confirm.
