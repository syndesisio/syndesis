= Clean up your integration

In this Technology Preview release, exactly one integration at 
a time can be running. In other words, exactly one integration can
be in the *Published* state. You can create another sample integration, 
but you cannot publish it while an integration is running. 

When you are done working with a sample integration, unpublish it and
delete it:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the main panel, identify the entry for the sample integration that 
you want to unpublish.
. In that entry, to the right, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab Menu] and then 
click *Unpublish*. 
. Click *OK* to confirm that you want to stop running the integration.
+
You can now publish another integration. 

. In the entry for the integration that you just unpublished, to the right, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab Menu] and then 
click *Delete*. 
. Click *OK* to confirm that you want to delete the integration.
