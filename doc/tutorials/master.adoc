= {prodname} Sample Integration Tutorials
:context: tutorials

{prodname} lets you obtain data from an
application or service, operate on that data if you need to, and then send the
data to a completely different application or service. You can do all this
without writing code.

Explore {prodname} by creating sample integrations. 
A <<comparison-of-sample-integrations_{context},comparison table>>
can help you decide which of these integrations to create first: 

* <<twitter-to-salesforce_{context}>>
* <<salesforce-to-db_{context}>>
* <<amq-to-rest-api_{context}>>
