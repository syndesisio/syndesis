= Understanding integration states

For a given integration:

* There can be exactly one draft version.
* There can be exactly one published version. A published version is running.

Each version of an integration is always in one of the following states:

[cols="2*"]

|*State*
|*Description*

|*Draft*
|*Draft* is always the initial state of a new version of an integration.
Only one version of an integration can be in the *Draft* state. That
is, you can update one version of an integration at a time.

|*Published*
|A *Published* version is running. When you publish an integration,
{prodname} builds the integration and starts running it. Only one version
of an integration can be running. That is, only one
version at a time can be in the *Published* state.

|*Unpublished*
|An *Unpublished* version is not running. It might have been
published and then unpublished, but it also might never have been
published. If no version of this integration is in the *Published* state, 
then you can publish an unpublished version to run it.  
If you publish a previously published version, 
then the newly published version has the same version number as when the
integration was previously published. If you publish a previously unpublished 
version, then the published integration gets the next available version number.

|*Error*
|An integration version that is in the *Error* state
encountered an error while being published or while running. The error
suspended publication or execution.  If this happens, try
publishing an earlier integration version that ran correctly.
Alternatively, you  can contact technical support for help.
To do that, in any {prodname} page, in the upper right, click the 
image:shared/images/InfoIcon.png[title="Help"] icon and select *Support*.
