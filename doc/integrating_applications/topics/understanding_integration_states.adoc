Each version of an integration is always in one of the following states:

[cols="2*"]

|*State*
|*Description*

|*Draft*
|*Draft* is always the initial state of a new version of an integration.  
Only one version of an integration can be in the *Draft* state. That 
is, you can update one version of an integration at a time.  

|*Published*
|A *Published* version is running. When you publish an integration, 
{prodname} builds the integration and starts running it. Only one version 
of an integration can be running. That is, only one 
version at a time can be in the *Published* state. 

|*Unpublished*
|An *Unpublished* version is not running. It might have been 
published and then unpublished, but it also might never have been
published. If no version of this
integration is in the *Published* state, then you can publish
an unpublished version to run it. The version number does not
change when you publish an unpublished version. 

|*Error*
|An integration version that is in the *Error* state 
encountered an error while being published or while running. The error
suspended publication or execution.  If this happens, try 
publishing an earlier integration version that ran correctly. 
Alternatively, you  can contact technical support for help.
