= Finding the data field you want to map

In an integration that has a few steps or that operates on a small set
of data, it is probably easy to find
the data field you want to map. But in an integration that has many steps, 
or that has a step that accesses a large set of data, the list of data fields 
might be very long. To quickly find the data field you
want to map, you can:

* Search for it. The *Sources* panel and the *Target* panel each have
a search field at the top. If the search field is not visible, click 
image:shared/images/magnifying-glass.png[Magnifying Glaass] at the top
right of the *Sources* or *Target* panel. 

* Expand and collapse folders to limit the visible fields.

As you add steps to an integration, {prodname} numbers and renumbers them to
indicate the order in which the integration processes the steps. 
When you are creating or editing an integration, these numbers are visible
in the integration visualization panel on the left. When you add a data
mapping step, the step numbers appear in the folder labels in the
*Sources* panel and in the *Target* panel.

To view the data fields available in a particular step, expand the 
folder for that step.

For some connections, you specify its input data type and/or its
output data type. When you specify the data type, you also give the type a name. 
For these connections, the type name you specified appears as the name of 
a folder in the data mapper. If you specified a description when you 
declared the data type, then the type description appears when you hover
over the step folder in the mapper.
