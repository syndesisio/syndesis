= Adding an AMQ connection to an integration

You must create an AMQ connection before you can add it to an
integration. If you did not already create an AMQ connection, 
see <<create-amq-connection>>. 

The procedure for adding an AMQ connection to an integration varies
according to whether you are adding the connection as the
start connection, the finish connection, or a middle connection.
