= Adding an AMQ connection to an integration

You must create an AMQ connection before you can add an
AMQ connection to an
integration. If you did not already create an AMQ connection, 
see <<create-amq-connection>>. 

After you add an AMQ connection to an integration, you might need to
specify a schema for the data that you plan to send to a JMS broker
or receive from a JMS broker. To do this, see <<add-describe-data-step>>. 

The procedure for adding an AMQ connection to an integration varies
according to whether you are adding an AMQ connection as the
start connection, the finish connection, or a middle connection.
