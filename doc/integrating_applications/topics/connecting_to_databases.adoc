= Connecting to SQL databases

In an integration, you can connect to any of the following types of 
databases:

* Apache Derby
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL

You create a separate connection for each database that you want to 
connect to in an integration. You can use the same connection in 
multiple integrations. 

A database connection operates on a table that you specify or invokes a stored
procedure that you specify. 
The database table or the stored procedure must exist when an integration
connects to the database. 

See the following topics for details:

* <<create-database-connection>>
* <<add-database-connection>>
