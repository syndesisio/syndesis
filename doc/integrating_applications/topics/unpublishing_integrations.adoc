= Unpublishing integrations

Each integration can have exactly one version that is running. A running
version is in the *Published* state. To stop 
running an integration, you unpublish it. 

To unpublish and integration: 

. In the left {prodname} panel, click *Integrations*. 
. In the list of integrations, identify the entry for the integration that you
want to stop running. The entry shows that this integration *Published*. 
. At the far right of this integration's entry, click

and select *Unpublish*. 

{prodname} stops running the integration. *Unpublished* appears in the
integration's entry in the list of integrations.
