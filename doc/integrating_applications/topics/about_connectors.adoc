= About {prodname} connectors

{prodname} provides a set of connectors. A connector represents a specific
application that you want to obtain data from or send data to.
Each connector is a template
for creating a connection to that specific application. For example, you use the
Salesforce connector to create a connection to
Salesforce.

If {prodname} does not provide a connector you need, a developer
can create the needed connector.
