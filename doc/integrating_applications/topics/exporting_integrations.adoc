= Exporting integrations

To export an integration:

. In the left panel of {prodname}, click *Integrations*. 
. In the list of integrations, identify the entry for the integration 
that you want to export.
. At the right of the entry, click 
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Three Vertical Dots] and
select *Export*. 

{prodname} downloads a zip file to your local `Downloads` folder. To import
the integration into another {prodname} environment, open that environment
and import this zip file. 

Exporting an integration is also a way to have a backup of the integration. 
However, {prodname} maintains the versions of an integration so exporting
an integration is not required for having a backup copy.
