= Connecting to AMQP

Advanced Message Queue Protocol (AMQP) defines communication 
between clients and message brokers. Use the AMQP connector to create a 
connection to one of the following broker types:

* Apache ActiveMQ broker that supports AMQP
* Apache ActiveMQ Artemis 
* AMQ 7 broker
* EnMasse, which is an open source messaging platform

To connect to one of the following broker types, use the AMQ connector:

* Apache ActiveMQ broker that does not support AMQP
* AMQ 6 broker

See <<connecting-to-amq>>.

[NOTE]
It is possible to use the AMQP connector to create a connection to an
Apache ActiveMQ broker that does not support AMQP or to an AMQ 6 broker.
Doing this requires transport configuration in the broker. 
For information about configuring the broker, see 
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_a-mq/6.3/html/managing_and_monitoring_a_broker/fmqadmintransportconnectors[Red Hat JBoss A-MQ Managing and Monitoring Brokers, Adding Client Connection Points].
For information about the configuration values to specify, see 
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_a-mq/6.3/html-single/connection_reference/index#AMQP[Red Hat JBoss A-MQ Connection Reference, Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP)].
