= Example workflow for creating a Salesforce to database integration

The best way to understand the workflow for using {prodname} is to 
create the sample integrations by following the instructions in the
{LinkFuseOnlineTutorials}[sample integration tutorials]. If you have
already done that, you can skip this section. 

The following abbreviated description of one of the samples provides
an example workflow for using {prodname}. These steps omit details, so
you should not try to follow them.

. Register your {prodname} environment as an application that can access
Salesforce. You need to do this only once to be able to create any number of
integrations that connect to Salesforce.

. Create a Salesforce connection. To configure this connection, {prodname}
prompts you to log in to the Salesforce account you used to
register {prodname}. You can use
the same Salesforce connection in any number of integrations.

. Choose your Salesforce connection as the connection that starts the
integration.

. Choose the action that you want the Salesforce connection to perform. In
the sample integration, you choose the *On create* action for the
*Lead* object. This means that after connecting to Salesforce, 
the integration watches for
notifications that a Salesforce lead was created. When the integration
finds such a notification, it passes the new lead's data to the next
step in the integration. However, before you can add the next step, you
must choose the integration's finish connection.

. Choose the *PostgresDB* connection as the connection that completes
the integration.

. Choose the action that you want the *PostgresDB* connection to perform.
In the sample integration, you choose *add_lead* as the procedure
you want to invoke. This is a provided stored procedure that runs in
the sample database. This procedure determines the requirements
for mapping Salesforce data fields to database fields.

. Add a step between the Salesforce connection and the database connection.
This step maps Salesforce data fields to database fields.

. Give the integration a name. Optionally, enter a description of what
the integration does.

. Click *Publish* to start running the integration.

. On the {prodname} dashboard, confirm that the Salesforce to database 
integration is designated as *Running*, which means that it is running.

. Confirm that the integration is working as expected by creating a new
lead in Salesforce.

. For this sample integration, in a browser, insert `todo-` in
front of the URL for your {prodname} environment. This displays the
notification that a new lead was created in the database.
