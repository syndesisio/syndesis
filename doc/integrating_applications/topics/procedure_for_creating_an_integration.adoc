= Procedure for creating an integration

To create an integration:

. In the left panel in {prodname}, click *Integrations*.

. In the upper right, click *Create Integration*.

. Choose and configure the start connection:

.. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click the connection you want
to use to start the integration. When this integration is running,
{prodname} will connect to this application and obtain data that you want
the integration to operate on.

.. On the *Choose an Action* page, click the action you want this connection
to perform. The available actions vary for each connection.

.. On the page for configuring the action, enter values in the fields.
.. Optionally, if the connection requires data type specification, 
{prodname} prompts you to click
*Next* to specify the input and/or output type of the action. 
.. Click *Done* to add the start connection.

. Choose and configure the finish connection:

.. On the *Choose a Finish Connection* page, click the connection you want
to use to complete the integration. When this integration is running,
{prodname} will connect to this application with the data that the integration
has been operating on.

.. On the *Choose an Action* page, click the action you want this connection
to perform. The available actions vary for each connection.

.. On the page for configuring the action, enter values in the fields.
.. Optionally, if the connection requires data type specification, 
{prodname} prompts you to click
*Next* to specify the input and/or output type of the action. 
.. Click *Done* to add the finish connection.

. Optionally, add one or more connections between the start connection and
the finish connections. For each connection, choose its action and enter
any required configuration details.

. Optionally, add one or more steps that operate on integration
data between connections. See
<<add-steps>>.

. When the integration contains all needed steps,
click *Save as Draft* or *Publish* according to whether you want
to start running the integration.

. In the *Integration Name* field, enter a name that distinguishes this
integration from any other integrations.

. In the *Description* field, enter a description, for example, you can
indicate what this integration does.

. If you are ready to start running the integration, in the upper right,
click *Publish*. Otherwise, click *Save as Draft*.

In the {prodname} *Integrations* page, you can see your new integration
in the list of integrations. If you published the integration, then you
can see that {prodname} is in the process of publishing it. It may take 
a few moments for the status of the integration to become *Running*. 
If you saved the integration as a draft, then
*Draft* appears on the integration's entry.

Click the integration's entry to see a summary of the integration, 
including its version history, logs for each execution, and aggregate
execution metrics.
