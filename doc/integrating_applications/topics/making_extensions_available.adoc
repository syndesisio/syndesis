= Making custom features available

To make a custom feature available for use in an integration, you upload
the extension to {prodname} as follows:

. In the left {prodname} panel, click *Customizations*. 
. At the top, click *Extensions*. 
. Click *Import Extension*. 
. Drag and drop, or choose, the `.jar` file that contains the extension 
that you want to upload.
+
A developer needs to make this file available to you. 
{prodname} immediately tries to validate that the file contains an 
extension. If there is a problem, {prodname} displays a message about the error. 
You must coordinate with the extension 
developer to obtain an updated `.jar` file, which you can then try to upload. 

. Review the extension details.
+
After {prodname} validates the file, it extracts and displays the extension's 
name, ID, description, and type. The type indicates whether the extension
defines a custom connector, or one or more custom steps for
operating on data between connections, or a JDBC driver for a 
proprietary database. An extension that provides a JDBC driver is 
referred to as a library extension. 
+
For a connector extension, {prodname} displays
the actions that are available to a connection that is created from this 
custom connector. In the extension, the developer might have provided an icon 
that {prodname} can use to represent the application connections created
from this connector. While you do not see this icon in the extension
details page, it appears when you create connections
from the custom connector. If the extension developer did not provide
an icon in the extension, then {prodname} generates an icon. 
+
For a step extension, {prodname} displays
the name of each custom step that the extension defines.
+
For a library
extension, if this extension contains a newer version of a JDBC driver that you 
previously uploaded, then you must remove the older version from your classpath.
Ensure that your classpath has only one version of this driver and that the
reference is to the newer driver you are uploading. Integrations that are running
and that use connections based on the older driver are not affected. 
New connections that you create will use the new driver.
If you start an integration that has a connection that was created with the
older driver, {prodname} automatically uses the new driver instead. 

. Click *Import Extension*. {prodname} makes the custom connector or 
custom step(s) available and displays the extension's details page.
