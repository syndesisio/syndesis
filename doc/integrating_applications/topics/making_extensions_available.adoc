= Making custom connectors or custom steps available

To upload an extension to {prodname}: 

. In the left {prodname} panel, click *Customizations*. 
. At the top, click *Extensions*. 
. Click *Import Extension*. 
. Drag and drop, or choose, the `.jar` file that contains the extension 
that you want to upload.
+
A developer needs to make this file available to you. 
{prodname} immediately tries to validate that the file contains an 
extension. If there is a problem, {prodname} displays a message about the error. 
You must coordinate with the extension 
developer to obtain an updated `.jar` file, which you can then try to upload. 

. Review the extension details.
+
After {prodname} validates the file, it extracts and displays the extension's 
name, ID, description, and type. The type indicates whether the extension
defines a custom connector, or one or more custom steps for
operating on data between connections. 
+
For a connector extension, {prodname} displays
the actions that are available to a connection that is created from this 
custom connector. For a step extension, {prodname} displays
the name of each custom step that the extension defines.

. Click *Import Extension*. {prodname} makes the custom connector or 
custom step(s) available and displays the extension's details page.
