= Identifying integrations that use extensions

Before you update or delete an extension, you should identify the
integrations that use customizations provided by that extension. 
To do this:              
                            
. In the left {prodname} panel, click *Customizations*.                         
                            
. At the top, click *Extensions*.                         
                            
. In the list of extensions, find the entry for the extension that you want 
to update or delete and click it. 

{prodname} displays details about the extension including a list of 
any integrations that use a customization provided by the extension.
