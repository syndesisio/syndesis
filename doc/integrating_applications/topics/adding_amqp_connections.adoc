= Adding an AMQP connection to an integration

You must create an AMQP connection before you can add an
AMQP connection to an
integration. If you did not already create an AMQP connection, 
see <<create-amqp-connection>>. 

The procedure for adding an AMQP connection to an integration varies
according to whether you are adding the connection as the
start connection, the finish connection, or a middle connection.
