= About mapping data

The data mapper displays:

* *Sources* - a list of the data fields that are obtained or 
processed in each previous step
* *Target* - a list of the data fields that are processed in the next connection

According to the needs of your integration, you can:

* Map one source field to one target field. This is the default
mapping behavior. For example, map the `Name` 
field to the `CustomerName` field.
* Combine multiple source fields into one target field. For example, 
map the `FirstName` and `LastName` fields to the `CustomerName` field.
* Separate a source field into multiple target fields. For  example, 
map the `Name` field to the `FirstName` and `LastName` fields.
* Transform the target field to specify how {prodname} stores it. 
For example, pad or trim the source field value, capitalize the first letter 
in a string, or create a timestamp.
