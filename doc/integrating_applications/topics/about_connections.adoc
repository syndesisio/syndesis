= About {prodname} connections

Before you can create an integration, you must create a connection 
to each application or service
that you want to obtain data from or send data to. To create a connection,
you select a connector and add configuration information. For example,
to create a Salesforce connection, you select the Salesforce connector
and then follow prompts for providing log in credentials so that
{prodname} uses the Salesforce account you choose when it connects to
Salesforce. 

To create an integraton, you select a connection to start the integration,
a connection to end the integration, and optionally one or more 
connections for accessing additional applications. 
Any number of integrations can use the same connection. 

For details, see <<connecting-to-applications>>.
