= Identifying where data mapping is needed

To identify where data mapping is needed:

. When you are creating or editing an integration, add all connections to
the integration.
. In the integration visualization panel on the left, look for any
image:shared/images/WarningIcon.png[Warning] icons.
. Click the icon to see the message. A *Data Type Mismatch* notification
indicates that you need to add a data mapper step before that connection. 

To see the input type or output type for a particular connection:

. In the {prodname} left panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the list of integrations, identify the integration that
has the connection whose input type or output type you want to know. 
. At the right of that integration's entry click 
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab].
. Select *Edit*. 
. In the integration's visualization panel, to the right of a connection, click 
image:shared/images/InfoIcon.png[Info] to display information about that
connection, including its input and/or output type.
