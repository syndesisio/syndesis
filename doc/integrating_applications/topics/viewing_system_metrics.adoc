= Viewing system metrics

System metrics appear on the {prodname} home page. To see them, click
*Home* in the left panel. {prodname} updates the following metrics
every 5 seconds:

* The number of integrations that are defined in this environment regardless of 
the integration state. A red cross indicates any integrations that
were running but that encountered an error that suspended execution. 

* The number of connections that are defined in this environment. 

* Total number of messages that have been processed by integrations in 
this environment in
the last 30 days. This includes messages that were processed by 
integrations that might no longer be running or that might have been 
deleted from this environment.

* Uptime indicates how long there has been at least one integration that
is running. The date and time when uptime started appears as well.
