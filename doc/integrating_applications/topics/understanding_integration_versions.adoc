= Understanding integration versions

In each {prodname} environment, each integration can have multiple
versions. The benefit of multiple integration versions is that
if you publish a version that does not work correctly, then you
can return to running a correct integration. To do that, you
unpublish (stop) the incorrect version and republish a version
that runs the way you want it to.

{prodname} assigns a new version number each time it publishes 
a new version of an integration. For example, suppose you publish the
Twitter to Salesforce sample integration. After it has been
running, you update the integration to use a different 
account to connect to Twitter. You then unpublish the running 
integration, which stops it, and publish the updated integration. 

The initial integration that was running 
is version 1. The updated integration that is now running is
version 2. If you edit version 2, for example to
use a different account to connect to Salesforce, and you publish that
version then it becomes version 3 of the integration.
