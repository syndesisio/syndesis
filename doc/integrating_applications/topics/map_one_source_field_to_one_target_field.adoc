You 
might need to expand an integration step to see the data fields that it
provides.

When there are many source fields, you can search for the
field of interest by clicking the 
image:shared/images/magnifying-glass.png[Magnifying Glass] and entering
the name of the data field in the search field. 
. In the *Target* panel, click the data field you want to map to.

The data mapper displays a line that connects the two fields you just
selected.

panels.
