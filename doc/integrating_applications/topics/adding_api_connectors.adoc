= Adding REST API client connectors

{prodname} can create connectors for
Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces
(REST APIs)
that support Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.
To do this, {prodname} requires a valid
Swagger 2.0 specification that describes a REST API you want to connect to.
If the API service provider does not make a Swagger specification available
then you must create the Swagger specification.

The following topics provide information and instructions for adding
REST API connectors:

* <<about-api-client-connectors>>
* <<about-swagger-specifications>>
* <<creating-api-connectors>>
* <<updating-api-connectors>>
* <<deleting-api-connectors>>

After you create a REST API client connector, for details about using
that connector in an integration, see
<<connecting-to-rest-apis>>.
