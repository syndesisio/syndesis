= Importing integrations

To import an integration:

. Open the {prodname} environment that you want to import the integration into. 
. In the left panel, click *Integrations*. 
. In the upper right, click *Import*. 
. Drag and drop one or more exported integration zip files, 
or navigate to a zip file that contains an exported integration and select it. 
. After {prodname} imports the file(s), click *Done*. {prodname} displays
information about imported integrations. 
. For each imported integration, if it uses a connection that requires
configuration, such as authorization credentials, you must add that information.
