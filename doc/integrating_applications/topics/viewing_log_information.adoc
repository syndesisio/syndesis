= Viewing integration log information

{prodname} provides log information for each integration version that
it executes. To see this information:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*. 
. Click the entry for the integration for which you want to view log
information. 
. In the integration's summary page, click the *Activity* tab. 
. Optionally, enter date and/or keyword filters to limit the versions
listed.
. Click the integration version for which you want to view log information. 

For each integration step, {prodname} provides:

* The date and time that the step was executed
* How long it took to execute the step
* Whether execution was successful
* The error message if execution was not successful

To log additional information between any two steps, you can 
add a log step to the
integration. A log step provides information about each message it
receives and can provide custom text that you specify. 
If you add a log step, then it appears as one of the integration's
steps when you expand the integration version that you want to view log
information for.  You view {prodname} information for a log step in the 
same way that you view {prodname} information for any other step. 

To add a log step, see <<add-log-step>>. 

You can also view log information for an integration in the 
OpenShift console. At the top of the *Activity* tab, click
*View Log in OpenShift* to view the log of the last pod that ran the
integration.
