= About creating a connection from a custom connector

After you upload an extension that defines a custom connector, the
custom connector is available for use. You use custom connectors
to create connections 
in the same way that you use {prodname}-provided connectors to
create connections.

A custom connector might be for an application that uses the OAuth 
protocol. Before you create a connection from this kind of connector, you must 
register your {prodname} environment for access to the application
that the connector is for. You do this in the interface for the application
that the connector is for. The details for how to register your 
{prodname} environment vary for each application. 

For example, suppose the custom connector is
for creating connections to Yammer. You would need to register your
{prodname} environment by creating a new application within Yammer. 
Registration provides a
Yammer client ID for {prodname}
and a Yammer client secret value for {prodname}
A connection from your {prodname} environment to Yammer
must provide these two values. 

Note that an application might use different
names for these values, such as consumer ID or consumer secret. 

After you register your {prodname} environment, you can create
a connection to the application. When you configure the connection,
there should be parameters for entering the client ID and the client
secret. If these parameters are not available, you need to talk with 
the extension developer and ask for an updated extension that lets
you specify the client ID and client secret.
