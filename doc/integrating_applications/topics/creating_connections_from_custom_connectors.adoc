= Creating connections from custom connectors

After you upload an extension that defines a custom connector, the
custom connector is available for use. You use custom connectors
to create connections 
in the same way that you use {prodname}-provided connectors to
create connections.

If the custom connector uses the OAuth protocol, then {prodname}
adds an entry for the custom connector to the {prodname} *Settings* page. This
is where you register this installation of {prodname} as a client of the
connector's application. 

For more information, see <<overview-of-creating-connections>>.
