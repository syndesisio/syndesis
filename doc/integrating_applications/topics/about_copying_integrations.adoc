= About copying integrations

Each {prodname} installation is an environment from which you
can export an integration. Exporting an integration downloads a zip file
that contains the information needed to recreate the integration in a
different {prodname} environment.

In an environment, each integration can have only one *Draft* version.

The result of importing an integration depends on:

* Whether the integration was previously imported
* Whether a connection that the integration uses was previously imported

{prodname} uses an internal identifier for each integration and each
connection to determine whether it already exists in the environment that
it is being imported into. If you change the name of an integration or
connection {prodname} recognizes it as the same integration or connection,
which just has a different name.

The following table describes the possible results of importing
an integration:

|===
|In the importing environment:
|What the import operation does:

|The integration has not been previously imported.
|Creates the integration. The integration is in the *Draft* state.

|The integration has been previously imported.
|{prodname} updates the integration. The updated integration is in
the *Draft* state. If there was a *Draft* version of this integration,
it is lost.

|The imported integration uses a connection that did not exist in the
environment before the import operation.
|{prodname} creates a connection that has the same settings except for
secrets. You must review each new connection. If a connection is not
completely configured for its new environment then you must add the
missing settings. For example, you might need to obtain secret settings by
registering this {prodname} environment as a client of the application that this
connection accesses.
