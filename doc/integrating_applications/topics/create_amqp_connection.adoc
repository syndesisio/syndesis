= Create an AMQP connection

To create an AMQP connection:

. In {prodname}, in the left panel, click *Connections* to 
display any available connections. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
connectors.  
. Click the *AMQP* connector.
. Configure the connection by entering: 
+
.. In the *Connection URI* field, enter the location you want to send data
to or obtain data from. 
.. In the *User Name* field, enter the username for the account that you want
to use to access this broker. 
.. In the *Password* field, enter the password for the account that you want
to use to access this broker. 
.. In the *Client ID* field, enter the ID that allows connections to close 
and reopen without missing messages. The destination type must be a topic. 
.. If this connection will be used in a development 
environment, you can save some time by enabling 
*Skip Certificate Check*. This is a convenience for 
development environments. You
should not enable this option for secure production 
environments. 
.. In the *Broker Certificate* field, paste the broker's PEM certificate text.
This is required except when you indicate that you want to skip
checking the certificate. 
.. In the *Client Certificate* field, paste the client's PEM certificate text. 
Content in this field is always optional. 
. Click *Validate*. {prodname} immediately tries to validate the 
connection and displays a message that indicates whether 
validation is successful. If validation fails, revise the configuration
details as needed and try again. 
. If validation is successful, click *Next*. 
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connections. 
For example, you might enter `AMQP 1`.
. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. For example,
enter `*Sample AMQP connection*`
. In the upper right, click *Create* to see that the connection you 
created is now available. If you
entered the example name, you would 
see that *AMQ 1* is now available.
