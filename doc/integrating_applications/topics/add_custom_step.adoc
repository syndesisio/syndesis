[id='add-custom-step']
= Add a custom step

If {prodname} does not provide a step that you need in an integration, 
a developer can define one or more custom steps in an extension. See 
<<making-extensions-available>>.

You add a custom step to an integration in the same way that you add
a built-in step. Create an integration, choose the start and finish
connections, add other connections as needed and then add steps. 
When you add a step, {prodname} operates on the data it receives from the
previous connection or the previous step. 

When you click *Add a Step*, the list of available steps includes any
custom steps that are defined in extensions that were uploaded to
your installation of {prodname}. 

At the top of the list of steps, in the *Name* field, you can select
*Custom Steps* to display only custom steps. 

Click the custom step you want to add to the integration.
{prodname} prompts you for any information required to perform the step.
This varies for each custom step.
