= About adding connections to integrations

When you add a connection to an integration, {prodname} displays a list
of the actions that the connection can perform when it connects to the
application. You must select exactly one action. In a running integration,
each connection performs only the action you choose. For example, when you
add a Twitter connection as an integration's start connection, you might
choose the *Mention* action, which monitors Twitter for tweets that
mention your Twitter handle.

Selection of some actions prompts you to specify one or more parameters.
For example, if
you add a Salesforce connection to an integration and choose the *On create*
action then you must indicate the type of object whose creation you are
interested in, such as a lead or a contact.
