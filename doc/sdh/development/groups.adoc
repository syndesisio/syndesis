## Maven Groups

Syndesis uses http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] as build tool.
Maven groups are used to separate the various Syndesis parts.

In details Syndesis consists of the following groups:

### Naming Conventions

The following conventions are used for naming directories, modules and Java packages.

IMPORTANT: These conventions are mandatory and should be also checked for when doing pull request reviews.

* Each directory directly below `app/` is specific for a certain Maven group.
E.g. the directory `app/extension` is reserved for all Maven modules belonging to the Maven group `io.syndesis.extension`.
The directory name is reflected as the last name part.
* All names (groups, modules, package) are using the *singular* form.
E.g. its a `io.syndesis.connector`, _not_ `io.syndesis.connectors`.
* Each Maven module is prefixed with the last part of the group name.
E.g. the directory `app/integration/api` holds a Maven module for the the Maven group `io.syndesis.integration`, and the module's artefactId is `integration-api`.
* A module's directory name is directly reflected as the last part of the Maven module name.
If the Maven module name consists of multiple parts (e.g. artifact `integration-project-generator`), then the corresponding directory is also a concatenated word (like in `integration/project-generator`).
Multipart names should be the exception, though.
* There should be only one level deep modules, so each Maven group directory holds all Maven modules flat.
* Each module has a *single* top-level package, reflecting the Maven module name.
E.g. for the Maven module `common-util` in group `io.syndesis.common` has a single top-level package `io.syndesis.common.util`
This top-level package should reflect the artefact name, with dashes replaced by dots.

NOTE: Not every module has been already transformed to this scheme.
This will happen step-by-step.
But for new groups and modules this scheme has to be followed.
