## syndesis build

The primary goal of `syndesis` is to build Syndesis.
It is mainly a wrapper around Maven but adds some convenience for common developer workflows.

### Usage
[source,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
Usage: syndesis build [... options ...]

Options for build:
-b  --backend                 Build only backend modules (core, extension, integration, connectors, server, meta)
    --images                  Build only modules with Docker images (ui, server, meta, s2i)
-m  --module <m1>,<m2>, ..    Build modules
                              Modules: ui, server, connector, s2i, meta, integration, extension, common
-d  --dependencies            Build also all project the specified module depends on
    --init                    Install top-level parent pom, too. Only needed when used with -m
    --skip-tests              Skip unit and system test execution
    --skip-checks             Disable all checks
-f  --flash                   Skip checks and tests execution (fastest mode)
-i  --image-mode  <mode>      <mode> can be
                              - "none"      : No images are build (default)
                              - "openshift" : Build for OpenShift image streams
                              - "docker"    : Build against a plain Docker daemon
                              - "auto"      : Automatically detect whether to
                                              use "openshift" or "docker"
    --docker                  == --image-mode docker
    --openshift               == --image-mode openshift
-p  --project <project>       Specifies the project to create images in when using '--images s2i'
-k  --kill-pods               Kill pods after the image has been created.
                              Useful when building with image-mode docker
-c  --clean                   Run clean builds (mvn clean)
    --camel-snapshot          Run a build with a specific Camel snapshot. You'll need to set an environment variable CAMEL_SNAPSHOT_VERSION with the SNAPSHOT version you want to use.
    --batch-mode              Run mvn in batch mode

[[syndesis-build-modules]]
### Modules
A plain `build` command without any options performs a plain `mvn install` for all modules.
This compiles all Java and Javascript artefacts and also runs all tests and code checks.

You also can compile only specific modules by using the `--module` (short: `-m`) option with a comma-separated list of modules.

The following modules are available:

[cols="3,15"]
|===
| **server**
| Main backend providing a REST API for the user interface

| **ui**
| The SPA user interface application

| **meta**
| Meta data and verifier used for verifying connections and providing connector metadata

| **connector**
| All connectors used by Syndesis out of the box

| **integration**
| Support libraries for running integrations

| **extension**
| Tools for developing and running Syndesis custom extensions

| **common**
| Common modules containing common code

| **s2i**
| S2I base image used for building the runtime images
|===

Also, to specify each module individually, you can also use some module groups:

* `--backend` (short: `-b`) for the modules `server`, `integration`, `meta`, `connector`, `extension`, `common`
* `--images` build all modules which result in Docker images, and also builds the Docker images in addition to the Maven artefacts.

When the option `--dependencies` (short: `-d`) is given in addition to `--modules`, also all modules which the specified modules depend on are build, too.

[[syndesis-build-tuning]]
### Tuning
By default, all checks like license or code quality checks are performed.
Also, all unit and local integration tests are run.
A full build eats up quite some time, but you should always run at full blast before submitting a pull request.

However, to speed up the turnaround, several speed-up options are available.
The following table shows these options, and also how long a full clean build over all modules takes: (but without building images)

[cols="3,15,2",options="header"]
|===
|Option
|Description
|Time

| _none_
| Default mode with all checks and tests
|

| `--skip-tests`
| Skip all unit and local integration tests
|

| `--skip-checks`
| Skip sanity checks like for correct license headers and
|


| `--flash`
| Fastest mode with skipping all checks and tests and with even some other aggressive optimizations
|
|===

[[syndesis-build-image]]
### Images
As described in <<syndesis-dev-modes,Development Modes>> there are two ways how Syndesis Docker images can be created and deployed.

You can decide which mode to use with the option `--image-mode` (short: `-i`) and the following options are available:

[cols="3,3,15",options="header"]
|===
|Option
|Shortcut
|Description

| `-i auto`
|
| Auto-select the mode based whether you are connected to OpenShift (e.g via Minishift) or not.

| `-i docker`
| `--docker`
| Enable Docker build mode. Access to a Docker daemon is required.

| `-i openshift`
| `--openshift`
| Use OpenShift S2I for building the images. An active login to OpenShift is a precondition for this. You can use `--project` (`-p`) for specifying the target namespace where to create the image. By default, it is created in the current namespace

| `-i s2i`
| `--s2i`
| Shortcut for `--openshift`

| `-i none`
|
| Don't build Docker images even when implicitly enabled (e.g. when using `--images`)
|===

Specifying the mode also enables building the Docker images which otherwise would not be built.

If the direct Docker mode is used it, you have to restart the Pods, so the newly created images are picked up.
For this you can use `--kill-pods` (short: `-k`) which will kill the corresponding pod after the image has been created.
This only works when you are connected to an OpenShift cluster (like for minishift)

[source,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
.Example
----
# Build all image with openshift mode
syndesis --images --openshift

# Build to the minishift Docker daemon
eval $(minishift docker-env)
syndesis -i docker -k

# Or:
# syndesis --image-mode docker

# Or:
# syndesis --docker

[[syndesis-build-camel-snapshot]]
### Building with a Camel snapshot

Suppose you've to build Syndesis with a local Camel snapshot, you can do that with the following commands

----
export CAMEL_SNAPSHOT_VERSION=2.21.0-SNAPSHOT
syndesis build --openshift --clean --camel-snapshot
