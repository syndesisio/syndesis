    [[SJMSBatch-SJMSBatchComponent]]
    SJMS Batch Component
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    *Available as of Camel 2.16*

    SJMS Batch is a specialized component for highly performant,
    transactional batch consumption from a JMS queue. It can be thought of
    as a hybrid of a consumer-only component and an
    link:aggregator2.html[aggregator].

    A common use case in Camel is to consume messages from a queue and
    aggregate them before sending the aggregated state to another endpoint.
    In order to ensure that data is not lost if the system performing the
    processing fails, it is typically consumed within a transaction from the
    queue, and once aggregated stored in a persistent
    `AggregationRepository`, such as the one found in the
    link:jdbc.html[JDBC Component].

    The behavior of the aggregator pattern involves fetching data from the
    `AggregationRepository` before an incoming message is aggregated, and
    writing back the result afterwards. By nature, the reads and writes take
    progressively longer as the number of aggregated artifacts increases. A
    rough example of this using arbitrary time units that demonstrates the
    impact of this is as follows:

    [cols=",,,",options="header",]
    |=======================================
    |Item |Read Time |Write Time |Total Time
    |0 |0 |1 |1
    |1 |1 |2 |4
    |2 |2 |3 |9
    |3 |3 |4 |16
    |4 |4 |5 |25
    |5 |5 |6 |36
    |6 |6 |7 |49
    |7 |7 |8 |64
    |8 |8 |9 |81
    |9 |9 |10 |100
    |=======================================

    In contrast, consumption performance using the SJMS Batch component is
    linear. Each message is consumed and aggregated using an
    `AggregationStrategy` before the next one is fetched. As all of the
    consumption and aggregation is performed in a single JMS transaction no
    external storage is required to persist the intermediate state - this
    avoids the read and write costs described above. In practice, this
    yields multiple orders of magnitude higher throughput.

    Once a completion condition is met, either by size or period since first
    message, the aggregated `Exchange` is passed into the route. During the
    processing of this `Exchange`, if an exception is thrown or the system
    shuts down, all of the original consumed messages end up back on the
    queue (or are placed on the dead-letter queue depending on the broker
    configuration).

    Unlike using a regular aggregator, there is no facility for an
    aggregation condition, meaning that it is not possible to batch consume
    into multiple groups of messages. All consumed messages are aggregated
    together into a single batch.

    Multiple JMS consumer support is available which allows you to consume
    in parallel using the one route, and at the same time use facilities
    like JMS message groups to group related messages.

    Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml`
    for this component:

    [source,xml]
    ----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
        <artifactId>camel-sjms</artifactId>
        <version>x.x.x</version>
        <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    </dependency>
    ----

    [[SJMSBatch-URIformat]]
    URI format
    ++++++++++

    [source]
    ----
    sjms:[queue:]destinationName[?options]
    ----

    Where `destinationName` is a JMS queue. By default, the
    `destinationName` is interpreted as a queue name.

    [source]
    ----
    sjms:FOO.BAR
    ----

    You can include the optional `queue:` prefix, if you prefer:

    [source]
    ----
    sjms:queue:FOO.BAR
    ----

    Topic consumption is not supported, as there is no advantage to using
    batch consumption within that context. Topic messages are usually
    non-persistent, and loss is acceptable. If consumed within a transaction
    that fails, a topic message will likely not be redelivered by the
    broker. A plain link:sjms.html[SJMS] consumer endpoint can be used in
    conjunction with a regular non-persistence backed
    link:aggregator2.html[aggregator] in this scenario.

    The `completionSize` endpoint attribute is used in conjunction with
    `completionTimeout`, where the first condition to be met will cause the
    aggregated `Exchange` to be emitted down the route.
