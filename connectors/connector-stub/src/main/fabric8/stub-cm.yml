    Stub Component
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    *Available as of Camel 2.10*

    The *stub:* component provides a simple way to stub out any physical
    endpoints while in development or testing, allowing you for example to
    run a route without needing to actually connect to a specific
    link:mail.html[SMTP] or link:http.html[Http] endpoint. Just add *stub:*
    in front of any endpoint URI to stub out the endpoint.

    Internally the Stub component creates link:vm.html[VM] endpoints. The
    main difference between link:stub.html[Stub] and link:vm.html[VM] is
    that link:vm.html[VM] will validate the URI and parameters you give it,
    so putting vm: in front of a typical URI with query arguments will
    usually fail. Stub won't though, as it basically ignores all query
    parameters to let you quickly stub out one or more endpoints in your
    route temporarily.

    [[Stub-URIformat]]
    URI format

    Where *`someUri`* can be any URI with any query parameters.
