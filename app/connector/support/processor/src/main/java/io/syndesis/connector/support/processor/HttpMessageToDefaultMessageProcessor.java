/**
 * Integrations may frequently overwrite message body content. HttpMessage is having issues with that
 * as it tries to read the request input stream cache multiple times in that case. This results to stream already closed
 * errors while processing the message body.
 *
 * Normal stream caching mechanisms on the http message implementation do not solve this issue as message body gets frequently
 * replaced while running the integration and this in particular is not covered.
 *
 * This replaces the message on the exchange so the type of the message is no longer HttpMessage and when copies of the message
 * are attempted the HTTP request stream is not read the second time. At which point the HTTP request stream might be closed.
