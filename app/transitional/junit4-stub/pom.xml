  <name>Transitional :: JUnit 4 stub</name>
  <description>
  Stub used instead of JUnit 4 dependency. These classes are used only
  so that the class hiearchy can be maintained.
  Functionality of these classes is not used, that's why they're empty,
  but they're needed to successfuly compile 3rd party dependencies
  without introducing junit:junit (JUnit 4) dependency. For one such
  case see:
  https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/970#issuecomment-625044008
